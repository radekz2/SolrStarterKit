            </head>
            <p>THUS my Lord, in the recent Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quisition of such a Son, forgot all his Losses, and cast the whole Weight of his late Calamities behind him. His Eye could not be tired with seeing him, neither his Ear with hearing the Sweetness of his Voice; and he continued to hold, to gaze at him, to caress him, un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mindful of aught else, unmindful even of
<pb n="4" facs="3" rend="none"/>his Friend <hi>Meekly,</hi> who sat enraptured be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>side him.</p>
            <p>Will you leave me again, my Child? cried out the Earl; do you intend to go from me again, my <hi>Harry?</hi> you must not, you shall not leave me, not for an Hour, no not for a Minute; a second Loss of my Son would quickly bring my grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave. Never, never, my Lord, will I leave you, tenderly cried <hi>Harry;</hi> never, for a Moment, will I for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sake you again, my Father. I come pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posely to watch over, to comfort, to tend you, while I have Life, with all possible Tenderness, Affection and Duty.</p>
            <p>But where, hastily asked the Earl, where is the Murderer who stabbed my Peace? where is that old Thief, that Robber, who rent my Child from me? Ah! my Lord, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> he is very far from meriting such opprobrious Epithets; He is a Summary of all that is excellent, all that is amiable in Nature. He respects and loves you too, above the World, and all that is in it deserving of Love. O, had you lately seen his Grief for your Losses, the Floods of Tears he shed,—for—for—for!—Here <hi>Harry</hi> could no more, but, on the Recollection of his Mother and Brother, burst into Tears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="4" rend="none"/>
But tell me, my Dear, continued the Earl, tell me who and what he is, whom you commend so highly?</p>
            <p>Even the Son of your own Mother, my Lord; my much loved, my revered, my most honoured Uncle.</p>
            <p>Impossible, my Child. That old des<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>picable Man my Brother. No no, my <hi>Harry,</hi> he must have deceived you. My Brother was All that was amiable upon Earth; <hi>the Fairest among ten Thousand,</hi> the straitest Cedar in the Forest.</p>
            <p>And such he is at this Day, my Lord. But, alas, alas, he has been broken by the Batteries of many Afflictions; a Man wholly made up of Sorrows, and acquaint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed with killing Griefs. You wanted me not, when he took me, my Father. You had other and richer Treasures, Comforts that were infinitely more worthy your Regard. But, little and despicable as I was, He had nothing but me. I became his only Comfort, the only Treasure in which he delighted. Yet, as soon as he hear'd that you wanted Consolation, he chose rather to be without it himself; and so he restores me to you, if I may be any little Matter of Comfort to you, my Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="5" rend="none"/>
And where is this dear Uncle, this precious Brother, my <hi>Harry?</hi> Is he come with you, shall I be so blessed to take him in with my Eye, to take him in with my Arms, to petition, to obtain his Pardon, to press him to my Bosom, to my Heart, to my Soul, where is he, where is this pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious Brother, my <hi>Harry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is not come with me, my Lord, he feared, as he said, that you would not forgive him the carrying off of your <hi>Gany<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mede,</hi> but he is desirous of attending you, on the first Intimation.</p>
            <p>Then you must write to him, for that Purpose, to Morrow, my Son, and dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>patch your Invitation by some of our swiftest Horses. The Influence of his Darling will, unquestionably, be greater than that of an offending and unnatural Brother. Is this Letter from him, <hi>Harry?</hi> — it is, my Lord. — Then, I will not peruse it, till I get by myself. It probably contains Reproaches but too well merited; or, possibly, Matters of Consola<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, too tender for me to bear. — But, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> my dearest <hi>Meekly,</hi> ten thou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sand Pardons! — <hi>Harry,</hi> take to your Arms the Man, in the World, next to your Uncle, most deserving of your Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verence, most deserving of your Heart!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="6" rend="none"/>
Here, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> kissed and embraced our Hero, with all the Tenderness of a Father and the Ardour of an old Friend.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> cried <hi>Harry,</hi> looking ear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nestly and fondly at him, do I not remem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber something of that Face, Mr. <hi>Meekly?</hi> Are you not the Gentleman, for whom I, long since, conceived such an Attachment, to whom my Heart cleaved, as I may say, from my Infancy?</p>
            <p>I am, my heavenly Creature, answered <hi>Meekly,</hi> I am the Man indeed whose Soul was knit to yours, like the Soul of <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> the first Moment I beheld you; and who saw in you, then, all those noble, generous, and divinely humane Propensi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties, that I see arrived to their Maturity at this happy Day!</p>
            <p>While Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> was thus rejoicing, <hi>Harry</hi> happened to turn his Head aside, and spying the lively Portraits of my Lady and Lord <hi>Richard,</hi> he started, he rose, and, gazing on them a Minute; he went softly to the Window, and, taking out his Handkerchief, kept his Back to the Company, while he vented his Emotions in a silent Passion of Tears. His Father and Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> perceived what he was about, but they did not disturb him. He
<pb n="8" facs="7" rend="none"/>brought fresh to their Remembrance all the Passages of late Affliction, and they silently joined a Flow of Grief to his. But their Tears were the Tears of sympathising Humanity: or rather Tears of Delight, on observing the sweet Sensibilities of their Darling.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time Mr. <hi>Frank,</hi> who at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended on <hi>Harry,</hi> had whisperingly given the mourning Domestics an Intimation, concerning the Person of the Stranger who had arrived. Some of them well remem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bered him; and All of them had hear'd of him, and conceived a very kindly Impres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of our <hi>Harry.</hi> They first expressed their mutual Joy, by Kisses, Embraces, and silent Shakes of the Hand; but, in a little Space, their Congratulations became more loud and tumultuous, and the Voice of Exultation was hear'd through all the lower House.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry,</hi> hereupon, felt himself secretly hurt, and turning to his Father his yet tearful Countenance, my Lord, says he, I beseech you to suppress this unseasonable Sound of Joy among your Servants, in a House that ought so justly to be the House of Mourning. — My Love, mildly and kindly answered the Earl, I cannot wholly refuse, to my poor and afflicted People,
<pb n="9" facs="8" rend="none"/>some Share of that Comfort which I myself feel on the Return of my <hi>Harry.</hi> They are All my old and true Servants, my Child, this is no other than an Expression of their Love to you and to me, and I request you to receive them affectionately for my Sake.</p>
            <p>Here the Earl rung a Bell, and desired tha tall his Domestics should come in.</p>
            <p>They accordingly entered. <hi>Harry</hi> per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fectly recollected Mr. <hi>John,</hi> the Steward, Mr. <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Butler, and old Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> the Cook. He called them by their Names, reminded them of old Times, and took them in his Arms with much Affection. He then turned to the other Servants. He took Each of them by the Hand in Turns, and spoke to them, with such a natural Ease and Lowliness, as though he himself desired, in his Father's House, to become also, <hi>as One of his hired Servants.</hi> Here<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>upon, gathering All about him, they catched and kissed his Hand by Force; and then, kneeling around, they promis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cuously petitioned for Blessings on his Head; and rising, retired in a pleasing Passion of Sobs and Tears; while the en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>raptured Earl beheld All; with a Mixture of such blissful Sensations, as he had never felt before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="9" rend="none"/>
It now began to grow late, and, after a short Repast of some small Matters; my Lord proposed their retiring to Bed, but, my Friend, said he to <hi>Harry,</hi> you must content yourself with being my Prisoner for the present; you must lie in my Cham<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber; I will not trust my Lamb from my Side, for Fear of its going once more astray. Ah, my Lord, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> there is no Fear of that. My Heart is wholly your Property, and you have, thereby, a sure Hold of all that I am or can have.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, <hi>Harry</hi> impatiently rose, before the Servants were stirring; and unlocking the great Door, and closing it softly after him, he went out exulting on his premeditated Expedition. He recon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>noitred and recollected the quondam Scenes of his Childhood, and, flying like a Bird over the Hedges and other Obstacles, he made the shortest Way to his still precious Mammy's.</p>
            <p>When he approached the Place of his infant Endearments, he met his Fosterfa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther going forth to his Field, with a so<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lemn and melancholy Air, on his usual Oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cupations. <hi>Harry</hi> instantly remembered the Features, once so delightful, and spring<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to him, and catching at him, he kissed and clasped him repeatedly, and cried a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>loud, my Daddy, my Daddy, my dear,
<pb n="11" facs="10" rend="none"/>dear Daddy <hi>Dobson!</hi> how glad am I to see you once again! how is my Mammy, my dear Mammy? how is little <hi>Tommy</hi> and little <hi>Rachel,</hi> and all our dear Family?</p>
            <p>The old Man then, respectfully with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>drawing a Space, I don't know you, my sweet Master, said he; I never saw you before. Indeed but you did; many and many a time and oft, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> you carried me in your Arms, almost the live<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>long Day, and pressed and hushed me to sleep at Night in your Bosom. Don't you remember, your little <hi>Harry?</hi> don't you remember my two Dogs, don't you re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>member my Cock?</p>
            <p>O, exclaimed the good old Man, I now believe that you are my Child, the dearest Child that ever was born! But, I never hoped to see him such a Thing as you are; I never thought to see such a glorious Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture upon Earth!</p>
            <p>Here, old <hi>Dobson</hi> returned <hi>Harry</hi>'s Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>resses with a two-fold Force, and, blubber<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing all aloud, had like to have smothered him with the Intenseness of his Embraces.</p>
            <p>Bring me, bring me, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> to the Sight of my dearest Mammy, I am all impatient, to behold her!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="11" rend="none"/>
Not so fast, said Gaffer <hi>Dobson,</hi> I love my old loving <hi>Cate,</hi> and, should she find you out, of a sudden, she would certainly die of Joy. But, I will bring you to her as a Stranger, and so you may bring Matters about. And, indeed, I fear that my own Head is likely to be crazed by this Business; for I do not find that I am the same Man that I was a while agone, I shall grow too proud, I doubt, and look down upon all my better Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Goodman <hi>Dobson</hi> then conducted <hi>Harry</hi> to their ancient Habitation. Nurse <hi>Dobson</hi> was just up, and preparing to comb the Heads of her Children, when they entered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cate,</hi> says he, I have brought to you a young Stranger, who says he can give you some Account of our little <hi>Harry,</hi> who says he is still alive, notwithstanding all your Frights, and will shortly pay a Visit to some Parts of this Country; and who knows then, but that we, among Others, may happen to set our Eyes upon him, and that, I think, would be a great Blessing, my <hi>Cate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O, no, no, no, exclaimed Nurse, with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out deigning to cast her Eyes on the Stran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ger; he is dead, he is gone from me these many many Years; I once hoped to have
<pb n="13" facs="12" rend="none"/>his Infant on my Knee and in my Bosom, but that Hope is quite gone; never, never shall I behold my Darling again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> had seated himself just opposite to Nurse; when, looking up, she started, and stared eagerly in his Face. Don't impose upon me, <hi>William,</hi> says she; tell me, tell me at once, mayhap this is my Child! Ah, against the World, the Dimple in that Smile, is the Dimple of my <hi>Harry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Harry</hi> sprung up and, at one Leap, caught his rising Nurse in his Arms, cry<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, my Mammy, my Mammy, my dearest Mammy, do I live to be pressed once more to your dear Bosom!</p>
            <p>But the poor Woman breathed short, and could not get out a Word. Twenty times she put him from her, and catched him to her again, gazing at him, by In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tervals, with a frantic Affection. At length, she cast herself back, on the Bench that was behind her, and, clapping her Hands together, she gave a great Shout, and burst into an hysterical Passion of Tears; while <hi>Harry</hi> seated himself beside her, and gently drawing her Head to him, placed it fondly on his Bosom, and mixed his Tears with her's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="13" rend="none"/>
This Gush came very seasonably for our loving Nurse's Relief. She soon recovered her Breath and her Senses; and, seeing some Drops on her <hi>Harry</hi>'s Cheeks, she drew them in with her Lips, crying, pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious Pearls be these! I would not exchange One of them for the brightest Diamond in the Mines.</p>
            <p>Mammy, says <hi>Harry,</hi> I stole away to come and see you, while my Father was asleep, or else I should not have had Leave to stir from him a Foot. But You and my Daddy must promise to come and dine with me, we will have a Table by Our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves. And do You, my dear Mammy, step to our House, and, if my Father should miss me, tell him I am gone into the Town and will be back with him before Breakfast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then stepped to the Village, and, remembering Gaffer <hi>Truck</hi>'s House, he went familiarly in, and enquired of the good Woman how all the Family was. Pray, how is my honest old <hi>Bartholemew,</hi> says he, and how is your pretty Daughter <hi>Molly,</hi> and above all what is become of my old Friend <hi>Tom?</hi> The poor Woman, all in Amazement, cried, a pretty <hi>Tom</hi> he is for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sooth, to be Friend to such a sweet young Gentleman as You are. But Truth is that
<pb n="15" facs="14" rend="none"/>our <hi>Tom</hi> is at prentice to a Barber at next Door. Well, says <hi>Harry,</hi> when Gaffer <hi>Truck</hi> comes Home, tell him that his old Acquaintance, <hi>Harry Clinton,</hi> called to see him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tom</hi> had just finished an Operation on a Neighbour, as our Hero entered. How are you <hi>Tom,</hi> says he, carelessly. <hi>Tom</hi> gaped, and stared, and gaped; but answered not a Word. Will you give me a Cast of your Office, <hi>Tom?</hi> Ay, that I will, Master, as soon you get a Beard. Why, <hi>Tom,</hi> you are grown a huge hulking Fellow since I saw you last; will you step to yonder Green and wrestle one Fall with me? No, no, Master, I should hurt you; methinks I could throw a Dozen of such fairweather Gentlemen as You are, Master.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> instantly seized <hi>Tom,</hi> by the Breast with one Hand, and by the Shoulder with the Other; when <hi>Tom,</hi> feeling the Hard<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness and Hurt of his Gripe, immediately ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>erted his Powers, and grappled with his Adversary. But <hi>Harry,</hi> giving him a slight Foot, laid him on the broad of his Back in the Middle of his own Floor; but kept him, with both Hands, from being hurt against the Ground.</p>
            <p>I believe, said <hi>Tom,</hi> rising, You must zertainly be the Devil; and come, as they
<pb n="16" facs="15" rend="none"/>say, to fling poor Sinners in the Shape of an Angel of Light. Ah, <hi>Tom, Tom,</hi> cried <hi>Harry,</hi> this is not the first Struggle that you and I have had. Do you remember the Bag of Nuts and poor blind <hi>Tommy?</hi> have you forgot your old Friend, your lit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle <hi>Harry Clinton?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bless'd Mercy! exclaimed <hi>Tom,</hi> can you be my young Lord, my Heart's dear young Master? I am indeed, answered <hi>Harry,</hi> your old Acquaintance, my dear <hi>Tom,</hi> your loving Friend, <hi>Harry Clinton.</hi> And so saying, he took <hi>Tom</hi> about the Neck and kissed him very cordially.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tom,</hi> says <hi>Harry,</hi> I want you to take a Walk with me; <hi>Tom</hi> instantly assented, and out they went.</p>
            <p>As they walked along, <hi>Harry</hi> began to grow sad. <hi>Tom,</hi> said he, do you know where my dear Brother <hi>Dickey</hi> was buried? Yes, Sir, said <hi>Tom,</hi> a great Way off, in yonder Church Yard below the Town's End. Do you know where the Sexton lives, <hi>Tom?</hi> In a little white House, Sir, just joining the Yard.</p>
            <p>As soon as they arrived, <hi>Tom</hi> called out the Sexton, and <hi>Harry,</hi> putting a Guinea into his Hand, ordered him directly to un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lock the Family Vault.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="16" rend="none"/>
The Man looked astonished, but obey<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed in Silence, and <hi>Harry,</hi> as he entered, desired the Sexton and <hi>Tom</hi> to wait at a Distance, and promised to be with them, by and by.</p>
            <p>He put to the Door after him, just leav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Light enough to distinguish the recent Deposits of the Dead.</p>
            <p>O, said he, as he advanced, thou true House of Mourning, thou silent End of all Men, how sad art thou to Sense! how sad to me above All, who bearest in thy dark Bosom such precious and beloved Relicks.</p>
            <p>Then, casting himself on the Coffins of my Lady and Lord <hi>Richard,</hi> as they lay Side by Side; and clasping his Arms about them as far as he could reach; O, he cried, my Mother, my Brother, my dearest Bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, my dearest Mother, you are gone, you are gone from me, and You never knew the Love that your Son and Brother had for You. Ah, how did I flatter my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, what Happiness did I not propose, in attending, serving, and pleasing You; in doing thousands of tender, kindly and en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dearing Offices about You! but you are snatched from me, my Mother, you are snatched from me, my Brother! all my Prospects are defeated and cut away for
<pb n="18" facs="17" rend="none"/>ever. You will no more return to me, but I shall go to You; and O, that I were laid with You this Minute in this still and peaceful Mansion; where Hopes and Fears cease, and All are humbled together!</p>
            <p>Mean while, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> and gone abroad on his Morning's Walk. He met Nurse on her Way to the Mansion House, and, accosting her in a kind of Triumph, my good Nurse, says he, we have blessed Ti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dings for you, Your <hi>Harry,</hi> your Hero, is come to the Country. I know it, Sir, I know it, answered Nurse, it is but a little while ago that my Babe left my Bosom.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> then proceeded in order to join his young Friend, enquiring of All he met which Way Lord <hi>Henry</hi> went, till at last he was directed to the Church Yard. There he found <hi>Tom</hi> and the Sexton who, on further Question, silently pointed to the Door of the Family Vault, that hung on the jar.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> felt himself affected, and withdrew to a greater Distance; but still keeping his tearful Eye on the sad Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion that now held the Living with the Dead.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Harry</hi> came forth, drying his Cheeks with his Handkerchief. He assum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
<pb n="19" facs="18" rend="none"/>a constrained Air of Chearfulness, and joining <hi>Tom</hi> and the Sexton, observed that a great Crowd was gathering in the Town.</p>
            <p>Who are Those, <hi>Tom?</hi> says he; I sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, answered <hi>Tom,</hi> your Honour's Te<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nants and old Acquaintances, who are get<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting together to welcome You to the Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try. If that is the Case, <hi>Tom,</hi> we must go and salute them; and You shall intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duce me and tell me who is who.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> perceiving that <hi>Harry</hi> was on his Return, kept onward, aloof from him, but with an Eye on his Motions.</p>
            <p>By this Time, the Crowd had sorted themselves, the Principals of the Families into one Group, the young Men into Ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, and the fair Maidens into Another. And, as <hi>Harry</hi> approached, They all set up a joint Shout of Triumph.</p>
            <p>Please your Honour, says <hi>Tom,</hi> this is my Father; and this is Gaffer <hi>Gubbins,</hi> and this Goodman <hi>Demster,</hi> and this Far<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer <hi>Felster,</hi> and so on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry,</hi> with the Lowliness of a Washer of Feet, would have kissed and embraced them All in Turns; but, pressing about him, they seized a Hand on either Side,
<pb n="20" facs="19" rend="none"/>and eagerly kissed them, as also the Skirts of his Clothes all round.</p>
            <p>God bless your sweet Face, God bless your sweet Face! cried Goodman <hi>Demster,</hi> who so sees it in a Morning, can't fail, I think, of prospering the live-long Day.</p>
            <p>When he came, in Succession, to the Companions of his Infancy, as he kissed and shook Hands with Each, in turn; Some reminded him of his having beat them at Boxing, Others at Wrestling, and All of his having play'd with them at Pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son-Bars, Leapfrog, Shoot the Gate, and so forth.</p>
            <p>Mean while, the Girls panted, gazed at him, and longed to get him to themselves. Sir, says <hi>Tom,</hi> here is your old Acquain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance, my Sister <hi>Molly;</hi> there is not a Lad, in the Town, whom she is not able to toss, except your Honour. <hi>Molly</hi> looked full of Health as <hi>Haebe,</hi> and rosey as the May, and <hi>Harry</hi> caught her about the Neck and kissed her very cordially. Do you remem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber me, <hi>Molly?</hi> O, answered <hi>Molly,</hi> I shall never forget, since your Honour's Lordship and I used to wrestle every Day behind our House. Ay, <hi>Molly,</hi> cried <hi>Harry,</hi> there was no Harm in it then; but a Fall, at this Day, might be Dangerous to One of us; above all things take Care of that,
<pb n="21" facs="20" rend="none"/>my good <hi>Molly.</hi> And, if you know ere a pretty Lad, to whom you have a Liking, I will give You fifty Guineas, for old Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quaintance sake, toward making up your Portion.</p>
            <p>The Rest of the Girls now pressed for their Share of <hi>Harry,</hi> and it was with Dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficulty that he divided himself with any satisfactory Equality among them, as they All kissed him so close, and seemed so loth to part.</p>
            <p>At length, <hi>Harry</hi>'s Watch reminded him that it was Time to attend his Father, and, as he parted, they shouted after him, long Life and Health and Honours, to our Townsman, our own Boy, our own dear sweet Child!</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> had re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turned Home, with his Heart full of Ti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dings to the Earl. When <hi>Harry</hi> arrived, Breakfast was on Table, and he perceived that his Father had been in Tears. But, no Notice was taken of the Affair at the Charnel House, on either Part.</p>
            <p>When Breakfast was over, <hi>Harry</hi> called in <hi>John.</hi> Mr. <hi>John,</hi> says he, can you tell me how many Families there are in this Village of Yours? Twenty five Families exactly, my Lord. Then <hi>Harry</hi> turned to
<pb n="22" facs="21" rend="none"/>his Father and said, if your Lordship will be pleased to lend me five hundred Guineas for the present, I will pay you very honest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly the Hour that my Uncle comes to the Country. Why, Sirrah, cried the Earl pleasantly, what Right has your Uncle to pay your Debts, especially to such a great Amount as you speak of? O, my Lord, an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swered <hi>Harry,</hi> I have already squandered away above fifty thousand Pounds of his Money, and this is but a Trifle which, I am sure, I may very safely add to the Rest.</p>
            <p>Here the Earl looked truely astonished. Fifty thousand Pounds! he exclaimed, impossible, <hi>Harry.</hi> Why, you had nei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther such Ponds or Lakes, as mine, in <hi>London,</hi> wherein you might make Ducks and Drakes of them. How, in the World, could you contrive it, where did you dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose of them?</p>
            <p>In Hospitals and in Prisons, my Father, answered <hi>Harry.</hi> In Streets and Highways, among the Wretched and the Indigent. Supplying Eyes to the Blind, and Limbs to the Lame; and Chearfulness to the Sorrowful and broken of Heart; for such was my Uncle's Orders.</p>
            <p>Let me go, let me go from this Place, my Lord, cried <hi>Meekly!</hi> this Boy will ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solutely kill me, if I stay any longer. He
<pb n="23" facs="22" rend="none"/>overpowers, he suffocates me with the Weight of his Sentiments.</p>
            <p>Well, <hi>Harry,</hi> said the Earl, go to my Desk, here is the Key of the Drawer on the left Hand, and I make you a Present of the Key and the Contents; perhaps you may find there nearly as much as will an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer your present Exigencies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> went and, opening the Drawer, was astonished to see it quite full of Gold. However he took no more than just the Sum proposed and, returning to his Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, said, what shall I do, my Lord, with that vast Heap of Money? Why, you ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>travagant Rogue, replied the Earl, there is not as much in it as will pay the Debt you have contracted with one Man. O, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> I am quite easy upon that Score; I will never affront my Uncle by the Offer of a Penny. And, don't you think, said the Earl, that we have got Poor among us in the Country, as well as you have in the City, <hi>Harry?</hi> I believe you may have got Some, my Lord, but then I am much more difficult, than you may think, in the Objects on whom I would choose to confer Charity. I look upon the Money, amassed by the Wealthy, to have been already extracted from the Earnings of the Poor, the poor Farmer, the poor Craftsman, the hard-handed Pea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sant,
<pb n="24" facs="23" rend="none"/>and the Day Labourer, whose seven Children perhaps subsist on the Milk of a Couple of Cows. Wherefore, the Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects, on whom we bestow these Gather<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings, ought at least to be something poor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er, and more worthy of Compassion than Those from whom the Money was exacted. So saying, he stepped out.</p>
            <p>Amazing Boy! cried Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> how new, and yet how just was that Observa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion! I am, cried the Earl, as it were in a Kind of delicious Dream, and can scarce yet believe myself so blessed as to be the Father of such a Child!</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Harry</hi> had called <hi>John</hi> aside. Mr. <hi>John,</hi> says he, here are five hundred Guineas. Be pleased to step and distribute them by twenty Guineas to Each of the Families in the Village. I would save you the Trouble, and give them my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, but that, for the present, my Heart turns with Disgust from their Thanks and their Honours. Tell them that this is a Token, in Memory of my dear Brother, to keep them in mind of him. Tell them further that I will have no Carousals, no Rejoycings, on Account of my Arrival; and that it would please me infinitely bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter, if my Return would bring their late Losses to their Remembrance, and set them All in Tears and Lamentations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="24" rend="none"/>
My Lord now proposed a Saunter into the Park, in order to procure an Appetite for Dinner. Accordingly the Gate was ordered to be unlocked; and they entered on a Gravel Walk, that was walled in on the left Hand, and paled in on the Right, along the Verge of five Canals that fell, successively, in Cascades, the One into the Other. Beyond the Canals, a vast Lawn fled the Eye, thinly interspersed with Trees of different Hues and Natures. The Lawn again was closed by an extensive Lake; and, on the further Side of the Lake, there rose and sunk several Glens, that varied their Forms to the Prospect, as they walked. Beyond the Glens there arose, again, to the Eye, a huge Forest of time-immemorial Oaks. And, beyond All, there ascended a Range of romantic Moun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tains, whose Fronts were whitened here and there with impending Rocks; but whose Tops scaled the Heavens, and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>founded their Forms and Colours with the Clouds.</p>
            <p>As they talked and walked along, they met with a six barred Gate that directly thwarted their Passage; and my Lord reached his Hand, through the Rails, for the Key, that the Keeper had left in the Lock on the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>side, but he could not get at it. We are All at a full Stop now, said he, unless <hi>Harry</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="25" rend="none"/>could make a Shift to climb over the Gate; but no, don't, my Dear, your Foot might happen to slip between the Rails and hurt you. I will obey your Lordship, answered <hi>Harry,</hi> I will not venture a Foot upon One of them. So saying, he catched at the topmost Bar with his left Hand, and, throwing himself slightly over, opened the Gate for his Companions. The Earl and Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> stood mute, in utter Astonish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment. At length the Earl cried, Child, you must surely be of more than mortal Mould, or else you have a familiar Spirit that conveys you through the Air. I have indeed a familiar Spirit, my Lord, answer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed <hi>Harry,</hi> a Spirit much humbled by the Sense of its own Defects.</p>
            <p>On their Return, <hi>John</hi> called his Master aside, and told him of his due Distribution of <hi>Harry</hi>'s Bounty to the Villagers. But my Lord, said he, when I went down I found them All very busily employed, in prepar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Bonfires and Illuminations in Honour of my young Lord. This, however, I was obliged to countermand, by his special Order; and it has greatly mortified all your poor People. Well, well, said the Earl, it can't be helped for the present; we must not dare to offend our <hi>Harry</hi> at any Rate; and so those Matters of Rejoy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cing may rest in Reserve till the Arrival of my Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="26" rend="none"/>
Soon afterward, our Hero's Fosterers came, decked out in their best Attire; and <hi>Harry</hi> ordered a side Table to be covered for him and them, but my Lord insisted on their dining all together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> placed himself very lovingly be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween them, at Table, that he might help them and prevail upon their Bashfulness to eat.</p>
            <p>When the Repast was nearly over, Nurse enquired after the little Beggar-Boy, whose Absence, she imagined, had caused the Elopement of her Darling. He is come to great Fortune, answered <hi>Harry,</hi> he has found his Father and Mother, and is Heir to a large Estate. <hi>Harry</hi> then told the Manner in which <hi>Ned</hi> had been discovered, and they were All highly pleased and affect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed by the Relation.</p>
            <p>But Mammy, says <hi>Harry,</hi> what is be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come of my Sister <hi>Nelly</hi> on whose Milk I was suckled? and what is become of my little Brother <hi>Tommy,</hi> who was but two Years younger than myself?—They are both dead, my Precious; but God has been pleased to give me Others in their Room. — Well, Mammy, I find we must all die, and, some time or other, that
<pb n="28" facs="27" rend="none"/>will be a great Grief to One of us, which<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever of us shall happen to outlive the Other. I am satisfied to die once, said Nurse, but, never let me hear again of your dying, my Angel, I can't suffer the Thought, she cried, and burst forth into Tears; I cou'dn't bear, I cou'dn't bear to die a thousand Deaths in the Death of my <hi>Harry!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Mammy, said <hi>Harry,</hi> in order to divert her Passion, you have not yet en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quired after the Man with the Beard. O, the old Rogue, exclaimed Nurse, I can't think of him with Patience. Ay, but, Mammy, you must know that, that same old Rogue is my own darling Uncle, an own and only dear Brother to my own dear Father here. If that is the Case, said Nurse, I don't wonder he should so great<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly yearn after you; and indeed I would rather wonder if all the World did not yearn and long after you, my Love!</p>
            <p>And now, Mammy, to shew you how much you are obliged to this same darling Uncle, he has ordered me to make you a Present of five hundred Pounds, in Pay<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, as he says, of the Grief he has cost you. And take no Heed for your Children, Mammy, I will take that Care upon my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self; for this same dear Uncle has made me a Gift of the Lands, and House, and Plate, and Furniture that he has in this
<pb n="29" facs="28" rend="none"/>Town, and so you see I am well able to provide for you All.</p>
            <p>Here, my Lord cast an Eye of tender Jealousy upon <hi>Harry.</hi> I perceive, my Son, said he, that your Uncle is your only Trust, the only Dependance that you choose to have upon Earth. <hi>Harry,</hi> with a Glance of his Eye, instantly caught the Meaning of the Eye of his Father; and, throwing himself at his Feet, O, pardon, my Lord, he cried, pray, pardon the Overflowings of a grateful and simple Heart! My Uncle is my Property, but I am your's, my Father, to be disposed of in Life, and in Death, at your Pleasure. I do trust, I do depend upon you, my Father, and you have already over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>power'd me with the Weight of your Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fections.</p>
            <p>My Lord's Eyes then glistened, and rais<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing his Son, and taking him fondly to his Bosom, I believe I have been wrong, my Love, said he; and hereafter I shall always think so, rather than think any thing amiss in my <hi>Harry.</hi> But, tell me, my Dear, and tell me sincerely; you speak of your Uncle, as One of the richest and greatest Men upon Earth; as a Prince, as an Em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peror, enabled to give away Fortunes and Provinces at Pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="29" rend="none"/>
And he is, my Lord, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> he is greater than any Prince or Emperor upon Earth. To speak only of his temporal Wealth and Power, the most inconsidera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble Part of his Value. He can do, as I may say, what he pleases in <hi>England.</hi> The Ministry are at his Beck, they profess them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves his Servants; and even his Majesty acknowledges himself deeply his Debtor, and owes him, I dare say, Half a Million of sterling <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet this is the Man, exclaimed the Earl, (turning an Eye of Penitence on Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi>) this is the Man, as I told you, my Friend, on whom I looked down with such provoking Contempt; whom I treated with such unpardonable Insolence and Ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nominy.</p>
            <p>My Lord then enquired concerning the personal Adventures of our Hero in <hi>Lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don,</hi> the Account of which would have been more entertaining, had not <hi>Harry</hi> suppressed, throughout his Narration, whatever he apprehended might tend to his own Honour.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Fosterers had taken their leave, my Lord proposed a Walk to his Guests, in the Gardens; and, after a few Turns, they sat down in a rural Arbour, that was interwoven, all about, with Jessa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mine and Honeysuckle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="30" rend="none"/>
Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> said the Earl, I have often longed to hear the Particulars of your Life, and how you came to live by Faith and not by Sight, and to hold your Conversa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion in Heaven, as you do at this Day.</p>
            <p>I can soon obey your Lordship, answer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed <hi>Meekly,</hi> for my Story is very short and very simple, and no way adorned with un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>common Incidents.</p>
            <p>My Mother died a few Hours after I was born. My Father did not survive her two Years; and I fell to the Care of my only Kinsman, an Uncle by my Father's Side.</p>
            <p>My Uncle was an old Batchelor, and though he was of a cold Temper and had no Tenderness for any One, he yet spared no Cost in my Education. He sent me to <hi>Eaton</hi> School, and from thence to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where I remained till I took my Degrees. I then went to <hi>London,</hi> bought a Sword and Sword-Knot, and commenced fine Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Though my Head had been duly stored, by my Tutors, in the Rudiments of our Religion, my Heart had not yet felt any of its Precepts; and I conceived that, to go regularly to Church, receive the Sacra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, confess myself a miserable Sinner,
<pb n="32" facs="31" rend="none"/>and avoid gross Vices, was the Sum of Christianity. I therefore entered, without Scruple, into all the fashionable Pleasures and Vanities of the Age; and I held that, to pardon an Affront, would have been One of the deadly Sins, in a <hi>Gentleman-Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Day, at <hi>James</hi>'s Coffeehouse, Colo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nel <hi>Stannard</hi> and another Gentleman en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gaged, at Backgammon, for five hundred Guineas; and, as the Stake was so consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derable, and both Parties celebrated for their Skill in the Game, we all crowded about them, to see the Issue.</p>
            <p>I happened to be next behind the Colo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nel's Chair, and Others pressed behind me, eagerly bending and looking over my Shoulders. At length he began to fret, as the Game was drawing to a Close and go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing against him. Pray, Gentlemen, he would cry, don't bear upon me so; for Heaven's Sake keep off, you will make me lose the Game. Hereupon, I did my utmost to bear back from him, but the Company pressed me forward, in Spite of all I could do. Till the Colonel, giving an unhappily decisive Cast, turned about in a Fury, and spit directly in my Face.</p>
            <p>Indignation gave me sudden and unusal Strength, and, casting All off who had
<pb n="33" facs="32" rend="none"/>borne upon me, I instantly drew my Sword and ran the Colonel through the Body. The Company cried out that all was fair, and opening a Window for me, they urged me to escape. Accordingly I got off, rode Post to <hi>Dover,</hi> and there embarqued for <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Colonel, God be praised, did not die of his Wound. He lay under the Hands of the Doctors for about seven Months, then recovered and went to join his Regiment in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this my Uncle sent me Advice, tell<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing me at the same Time that I might re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn with safety. Yes, thought I, with safety to my Life, but with Death to my Honour! I have taken Revenge indeed, but not Satisfaction; the Colonel must be compelled to make me personal Reparation for the Affront which he dared to put upon me. His Recovery has again dashed the Spit into my Face; and I will pursue him through the World, till it is wiped from the Observation and Remembrance of all Men.</p>
            <p>With this deadly Determination, I went Post, from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and traced the Colonel from Place to Place, till I found him in a Village, on the Road to <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="33" rend="none"/>
I believe, Sir, said I bluntly, you mayn't remember me, for our Acquaintance was sudden and of very short Duration; I am the Man in whose Face you spit publickly, at <hi>James</hi>'s Coffeehouse. Then, Sir, said he, I am scarce yet recovered of the Cause which you gave me to bear you always in Mind; but pray, what may your Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mands be with me, for the present? I am come to demand a Remedy, at your Hands, for the Wound which you gave my Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour, and which otherwise must remain for ever incurable. Ah, he cried, no Man ever exacted so severe a Satisfaction as you have already taken; what then may be the Nature of the further Reparation, that you are pleased to require? Either to ask my Pardon, or fight me within this Hour.</p>
            <p>That is very hard upon me, indeed, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plied the Colonel; the Honour of my Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mission will not allow me to beg Pardon of any Man, at least in order to avoid a Combat; so Sir, if you insist upon it, I must obey your Summons, though very reluctantly, I confess. Then Sir, said I, meet me in Half an Hour, with your Pis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tols and Sword, behind yonder little Hill.</p>
            <p>The Colonel was punctual to the Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointment. We both grasped a Pistol, at a Distance of twenty Paces, and advancing,
<pb n="35" facs="34" rend="none"/>Step by Step, cried fire! fire! fire! Each seeming determined to make sure of his Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versary; till, coming within Arm's length, I fired directly in his Face, but the Ball passed through his Hat, and only grazed the Skin of his left Temple.</p>
            <p>The Colonel then took his Pistol into his left Hand, and reaching out his Right to me, with a Smile of great Complacence, I think Sir, said he, I may now ask your Pardon with Honour And to convince you that I did not come to engage You in Malice, be pleased to examine my Arms, you will not find so much as a Grain of Powder in the One or the Other.</p>
            <p>Ah, Colonel, I then exclaimed, I acknow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge you my Conqueror both in Honour and Humanity. Had I been so unhappy as to kill you, and find your Arms unload<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, I should certainly have done you Jus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tice, by shooting myself through the Head. But, why did I pursue you from Kingdom to Kingdom; why was I unappeased by all the Blood that I shed? was it from any Malignity of Heart toward you? by no Means; but, while I lamented the Misery I had already occasioned You, I was impel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>led to finish your Destruction, by a barba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rian World, or rather, by the bloody Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scribers of Custom, whose Censure I dread<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, worse than Death, or even Futurity.
<pb n="36" facs="35" rend="none"/>Courage, Colonel, incites Soldiers to fight for their Country; but it is Cowardise alone that drives Duellists together.</p>
            <p>For three affectionate Days, I remained with my late Enemy, but now warm Friend. He then was obliged to return to Quarters; and we parted, with a Regret much ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeding the Hostility with which we had met.</p>
            <p>On the Departure of the Colonel I went to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> from whence I drew upon my Uncle to the amount of £700. For I resolved, before my Return, to take a Tour through the Seven Provinces, though I had gone for a very different Purpose.</p>
            <p>During nine Months I resided, or jour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neyed from Place to Place, among that People. <hi>Holland</hi> is, unquestionably, the wealthiest, the busiest, and most populous State upon Earth. Not a Hand is unem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ployed, not a Foot of Ground unoccupied; and, for a long time, I ascribed their ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>traordinary Prosperity to an Industry and Ingenuity peculiar to them alone. But, on further Observation, I discovered the true Source as well of their Industry as their Opulence, and am persuaded that any Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, bordering on the Ocean, might de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rive the like Prosperity from the same Spring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="36" rend="none"/>
Not, my Lord, that I think Opulence a real Benefit to a People, for <hi>Man's Life consisteth not in the Abundance of his Possessions.</hi> But I look upon Industry, the natural Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rent of Opulence, to be as well a Blessing as a Duty to Man, from the Time that he was appointed to <hi>earn his Bread in the Sweat of his Brow.</hi> Many mental Virtues, also, as well as temporal Benefits follow in the Train of Industry; it makes Men health<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful, brave, honest, social, and pacific. He, who labours hard to acquire a Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty, will struggle hard to preserve it, and Exercise will make him active, robust and able for the Purpose. As the Man of In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry hath, in himself, a living Fund of Competence for his own Occasions, he will be the less tempted to plunder or prey up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on Others; and the poignant Sense and Apprehension of being deprived of a Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty, so justly acquired, will give him the nicer and stronger Sense of such an Injury to Others. Industry further incites to Commerce and good Neighbourhood, in order to dispose of mutual Redundancies for the Supply of mutual Wants. And, lastly, it delighteth in Peace, that its Time and its Labours may not be interrupted, nor the Fruits thereof endangered, by Rapine and Invasion; and all this may be said of Nations, as well as of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="37" rend="none"/>
Your Observations, said the Earl, are perfectly just; the Works of Industry are, unquestionably, the Works of Peace, and tend to open the Avenues wherein the Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tues may walk. But, how to incite Men or Nations to Industry, that is the Ques<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion. The finer Arts, we see, may be en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>couraged and promoted by National Boun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties, as now in <hi>France;</hi> but there is no in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>citing the Bulk of the People to Industry, in like Manner; that would be, as though the Public should grant a Bounty to itself. Nations certainly differ from Nations as Man differs from Man; Some are, by Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, industrious and ingenious, such as <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> it is their Propensity, their Talent; while Others, like <hi>Ireland,</hi> are naturally lazy and listless, and therefore remain in well merited Indigence.</p>
            <p>You have greatly mistaken this Point indeed, my Lord. <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> are industrious and ingenious, because, whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther it were through good Hap or good Policy, they hit upon the only Method whereby Industry and Ingenuity could be duely promoted. Whereas <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are totally ignorant of the said Method to this Day, though Both of them highly capable of having it put in Exe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="38" rend="none"/>
You surprise me, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> said the Earl, a Method to make Men ingenious, a Method to make them industrious! how can that be?</p>
            <p>Experience has proved it to be even so, my Lord; for where a Method may be found for encouraging and promoting In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>genuity and Industry, that Method will, infallibly, make People become both inge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nious and industrious. No Man will work, my Lord, without some Hire, or Wages, or Return for his Labour; neither will Any, who are in Want, refuse to work, when assured of a due Reward for so doing.</p>
            <p>When the good Housholder walked out to the Marketplace, and found Labourers loitering there, when it was now toward Evening, he asked them, <hi>why stand ye here all the Day idle?</hi> And when they answered, <hi>because no Man hath hired or given us Em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ployment,</hi> he took this for a sufficient Apo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logy, he had Compassion upon them, and he supplied them with the divinest of all Kinds of Charity, <hi>the Means of earning their own Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, throughout <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> no Person is in Want, because All are hired, All employed, the Young and the Old,
<pb n="40" facs="39" rend="none"/>the Lame and the Blind; and All find a ready Sale, without Anxiety or Loss of Time, without Travel or Delay, for the Products of their Industry. Throughout <hi>Great Britain,</hi> on the contrary, Nineteen in Twenty are in real Want; and in <hi>Ire<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land,</hi> as I am told, Forty nine, in Fifty, are nearly in a State of Beggary, merely for want of being employed, for want of Encouragement to Labour.</p>
            <p>Permit me, then, to explain to your Lordship, how some Men, and some Nati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons, come to be encouraged to Industry, and Others to be discouraged, or, in a Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner, prohibited from it.</p>
            <p>Different Men are endowed with dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent Talents and Powers, insufficient in many Respects, though superfluous in Others, to their own Occasions. Different Countries are also endowed with different Productions, superfluous in many Respects to the Natives, though necessary or desi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rable for the Well-being of Foreigners.</p>
            <p>Now, these alternate Qualities, of De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficience and Abundance, at once invite and impel all Men, and all Countries, to claim and to impart that reciprocal Assistance which is denominated Commerce. Each gives what he can spare, Each receives
<pb n="41" facs="40" rend="none"/>what he wants; the Exchange is to the mutual Advantage of all Parties. And, could a Method be found out for encourag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Manufacturers to persevere in their In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry, and improve in their Arts, by a ready Conveyance and Sale of all their Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dundancies, neither Want nor Superfluity could find Place upon Earth.</p>
            <p>All this is quite clear and self-evident, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> but how to procure this ready Sale is the Question.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship must allow that the Way to procure it would be to bring Barterers and Commuters, Buyers and Sellers! All who mutually want and mutually abound, together. For this is the End and Purpose of every Market upon Earth.</p>
            <p>Now, in <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in all Continents or inland Countries, the several Desarts, Mountains, Marshes, and other Obstacles, with the Difficulty, Dan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ger, and Toil of Travel, and the great Expence of Land Carriage, have utterly precluded all Commerce and Communica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to any considerable Extent. Insomuch that it would be easier and cheaper to con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vey a Commodity, of any Burden, to ei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther of the <hi>Indies,</hi> than from many Parts of <hi>Great Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> to Others, by Land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="41" rend="none"/>
While God appears to separate the seve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral Nations of the Earth from Each other, by the Intervention of Seas, Lakes, and Rivers, he hath actually and intimately united them thereby.</p>
            <p>WATER serves to the Art and Naviga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of Man, as Air serves to the Wings of the feathered Species. It is the easy and speedy Medium, the ready Conduit and Conveyance, whereby all Redundancies are carried, and all Wants supplied. It makes Man, as it were, a Denizen of every Country on the Globe. It shortens every Distance, and ties the remotest Regions to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gether. It carries and communicates the Knowledge, the Virtues, Manufactures, and Arts of each Climate to All. It gives new Springs and Motives to Industry, Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, and Invention. It gives a general Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portance to the meanest Manufacturer. It gives to each Man an Interest in whatever is done upon Earth, the Productions of every Region, and the Tribute of every Nation.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> are the only Countries upon Earth, who have consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ably availed themselves of this capital Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nefit of Water-Carriage, or Water-Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce; and therefore they are, incompa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rably, the most populous and most pros<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perous of all Countries in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="42" rend="none"/>
               <hi>China,</hi> as your Lorship knows, extends from under the Tropic of <hi>Cancer</hi> to about thirteen hundred Miles <hi>North,</hi> and there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>by contains within itself all the Variety of Climate, and Degrees of Heat and Cold, that are requisite for the sundry Producti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons upon Earth. Inspired by some Fore<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cast, or Sagacity, not imparted to the rest of Mankind, they cut and quartered this vast Continent, by as many navigable Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nals as answer to the Ducts and Veins in the human Body, for the Dispensation of Life and Nourishment. These Canals serve as Links or Chords to the grand Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>munity of the <hi>Chinese,</hi> they bind Region to Region, House to House, and Man to Man, and hold the Whole as one System or Family together. This great Kingdom is, thereby, become as one City, and the Canals as so many Streets, through which Plenty is diffused by Commerce to every Part. If any Art or useful Invention com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mences or receives Improvement in any Place, it is immediately conveyed to every Place for Imitation and Promotion. No Portion of this wide Continent lies waste or uncultivated, because the Canals are as so many Markets brought to every Man's Door, and, by the perpetual Demand of whatever is saleable, incite the Natives to exert themselves in providing all the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dundancies they possibly can, that they may derive Wealth to themselves by supplying
<pb n="44" facs="43" rend="none"/>the respective Wants of Others. Thus, throughout the expanded Dominion of <hi>China,</hi> nothing is wasted, nothing lost, nothing superfluous, nothing wanting. All are employed, active, industrious, ingenious, and thriving. Their Canals are intimately to them, what Seas are diffusively to the rest of the Globe. They are thereby be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come, as a World within themselves, suffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cient to their own Happiness and Occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions. They never change their Manners or Policy. They never enterprise War against Others. And <hi>China</hi> is affirmed at this Day, to contain one hundred and twenty Million of prospering Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> also, about a hundred and forty Years ago, followed the Example of the <hi>Chinese.</hi> Their Country is now become as one great and extended Metropolis to the Universe; and through their Canals as through paved and spacious High-Ways, the World resorts with all its Wealth. So encouraged and so incited, neither the Lame, nor the Blind, nor the Maimed, sit unemployed. Every Child is taught its Trade from the Moment it can apply its little Hands to a regular Motion, and they bring to the Parents vast Sums, in lieu of an infinite Variety of Toys and Trifles that are dispersed among the Idle of the other Children of Men. For, Barterers, and Commuters, Buyers and Sellers, Manufac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turers
<pb n="45" facs="44" rend="none"/>and Merchants, like <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe,</hi> want nothing but the removal of en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vious Obstacles, to meet and to multiply a similary Progeny.</p>
            <p>From what has been premised, my Lord, it is most evident, That Industry is the Parent of the Wealth of this World. That no Man's Industry is sufficient to his own Occasions. That the mutual Assis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance denominated Commerce is, therefore, necessary to the Well-being of all People. That the reciprocal Advantage of this Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce consists in supplying mutual Wants with mutual Redundancies. That this Commerce, however, cannot be carried on without a Medium for the Conveyance of such Supplies. That such a Medium, by Land, even where it is practicable, is tedi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous, toilsome, expensive, extremely dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>couraging, and cannot be pushed to any considerable Extent or Effect. That God, however, hath opened for the Purpose, an easy, speedy and universal Medium of Seas, Lakes, and Rivers, Part of which he hath left unnavigable, that Man might finish, by Art, what Nature had prepared, and contribute in some Degree to his own Advantages. That accordingly <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> (and <hi>France</hi> of late) have pursued the Path so divinely appointed, and that Power, Wealth and Prosperity have flowed in upon them, in Proportion as they have
<pb n="46" facs="45" rend="none"/>opened the Medium of Water-carriage for their Reception. And, that Causes which have produced their concomitant Effects, without Variation, from the earliest Ages to the present Period, must be presumed to produce the like Effects, through all Countries and Ages to the End of Time.</p>
            <p>I protest, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> exclaimed the Earl, you have pushed this Matter into mathematical Demonstration. What a happy, what a glorious Prospect now opens to my View! How easily, how speedily, how profitably might this Method be put in Execution, throughout the Earth! There is no Deficiency of Rivers, or collateral Streams for the Purpose. The Sinking in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to the Earth would give Vent to new Springs, and extract Plenty of Water in all Places for an inland Navigation; and Half the Number of Hands, that perish through War and Want, might be peacefully and plentifully employed in accomplishing this Weal of Mankind. Famine and Depreda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion would then cease. Nation would no longer rise up against Nation, nor Man against Man. The Earth, by Culture, would soon become capable of sustaining tenfold the Number of its present Inhabi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tants. We should no more be tempted to push Each Other from Existence. We should find ourselves mutually interested in preserving and multiplying the Lives of
<pb n="47" facs="46" rend="none"/>All from whose Labours we were to derive such Advantages. All would be Plenty, All Peace and Benevolence throughout the Globe. The Number of Inhabitants, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stead of being a Burden, would then be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come the Riches of every Climate. All Hands would be set to Work, when thus assured of a Purchaser for every Effect of Labour. The Buzz of Wheels, Reels, and Looms; the Sound of Hammers, Files, and Forges; with the Shouts of Vintage, and the Songs of Harvest, would be heared in all Lands! I am quite astonished that a Work, so full of Benefit and Blessing to the Universe of Man, is not already commen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ced, advanced, and compleated.</p>
            <p>How comes this to pass, Mr. <hi>Meekly?</hi> Have You yet mentioned this Matter to Any of our Great Ones?</p>
            <p>I have, my Lord, to Several. They con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fessed themselves convinced of the Utility of the Scheme; and, could Each of them be assured of engrossing to himself the most considerable Part of the Profits that would thereby accrue to the Public, the Work would instantly be begun, and would short<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly be perfected. For, such is the Nature of unregenerate Man, that he grudges to Others any Portion of those Goods which he so eagerly craves and grapples after for himself. He would hedge in the Air, and
<pb n="48" facs="47" rend="none"/>make a Property of the Light. In Propor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion as he sees his Neighbours in compara<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive Want, he exults in the Accumulation of imaginary Wealth. But, should he deem them, in a Measure, more prospe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous than himself, he sighs at his inmost Soul, and grows wretched and repining.</p>
            <p>I protest, cried the Earl, were I young, I would to Morrow Morning, at my own Cost, set about this great Work of national, or rather of universal Beneficence. But, my <hi>Harry</hi> here has Youth enough, with an Abundance of Benevolence also for the Purpose; and I recommend it to him as the greatest of Charities, a Charity to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> a Charity to Mankind. What would you think, my Lord, said <hi>Harry,</hi> of my expending your whole Drawer of Gold upon this Business? great as it is, it would be but a small Matter toward the Value of purchasing Peace up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on Earth, and the Sons of Peace, upon Earth, will be likeliest to be the Sons of Love in Heaven. So that we cannot lay out our Money to better Advantage, in any Purchase for the Benefit of the Brothers of our own Frailty.</p>
            <p>Alas, my Love, rejoined Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> though you were Master of Half the Wealth of the People of <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb n="49" facs="48" rend="none"/>were willing to employ the Whole for their Emolument in this Way, the People them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves would oppose you in every Step you should take. Some would be too proud to accept a Benefit from You. Others would tell you that no Man should dare to violate their Property with either Spade or Pick-Axe; and Others would indict you even for treading on their Grounds. No<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing less than the Act of the whole Le<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gislature, to whom the People have com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitted their confluent Powers, can avail for an Undertaking of such National Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port.</p>
            <p>Then, my dear Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> be pleased to let me have, in Writing, what you have already set forth on this Head; and, if I live to come to the lower House of Parlia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, I will bend all my Powers to this capital Charity. And, if no other Oratory will avail for the Purpose, I will bribe the Members with a hundred thousand Pounds, and corrupt them, if possible, into one Act of Patriotism

            <p>On my Return to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> from my Tour through the Seven Provinces, I grew affected, one Evening, in a Manner I had never before experienced. I did not feel myself any way sick or in pain, and yet I wished to exchange my Sensations for any other Species of Malady. I was wholly pervaded by a gloomy Despondence. I looked abroad for Comfort, but it was no where to be found, every Object gave Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gust to my discontented Imagination. I secretly enquired of my Soul, if Riches, Honours, Dignities, if the Empire of the World would restore her to Joy? But She turned from them and said, All these Things are Strangers, and Aliens to my Peace. Alas, said I, tell me then where your Peace may be found? I know not, she replied, but I feel that I am wretched.</p>
            <p>For three Days I continued under this Oppression of Spirit. And on the third Night an increasing Horror, of deep and
<pb n="51" facs="50" rend="none"/>heavy Darkness, fell upon me. All Hope died within me, and Misery seemed to open a Gulph of ever deepening Destruction in my Soul. I lay all the Night, bathed in Drops of unutterable Anguish. I wished and struggled to arise and change my Si<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuation, but I felt that my Mind was its own Place and its own Hell, from whence there was no Removal, no possible Escape.</p>
            <p>I now concluded that, some how, I must have sinned beyond the Measure of all Sin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners, since my Damnation was deeper than that of any Other. I therefore turned to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward God and wished to repent; but, as I did not feel Conviction for the Sins of which I accused myself, no Place for Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pentance was found in my Soul.</p>
            <p>Tremendous Author! I cried, I find that thou can'st sink and slay at Pleasure, but can'st thou not also raise up and make alive? If all Things have their Existence in thee, O God! is it not near and easy unto thee to impart to us some Sensation of thine own Existence also? some Sensa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of thine own Peace, the Sense that it is thou alone who can'st be our Sustainer? Save me, <hi>Jesus,</hi> save me from the Hell of mine own Nature! Save me, thou Son of <hi>David,</hi> O save me from Myself!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="51" rend="none"/>
While I thus prayed in an Agony, my whole Frame was suddenly overpower'd and sunk, as I suppose, into a State of In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sensibility, till the following Day was far advanced. At length I perceived that I still existed.</p>
            <p>I dreamed that I found myself in a deep and noysome Dungeon, without a single Ray that might even suffice to shew me the Horrors of my Situation. I attempted to rise and grope about, but I perceived that I was tied and fastened down to Earth by a Number and Variety of Bands and Fet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters.</p>
            <p>At length a sudden Light appeared, and diffused itself throughout the Darkness of my Mansion. When, looking up, I ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>served that the Keeper of my Prison had entered, the Doors being yet locked. His Head, as I thought, was bound about with a Tiara, from whence the Glory arose that shone around me. In the Coronet, instead of Gems, were inserted a Number of Thorns, whose Points streamed with incessant and insufferable Brightness. And on the golden Circlet was engraved, in all Languages, JESUS OF NAZARETH KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
            <p>Immediately my Shackles loosened and fell away of themselves, and I wished to
<pb n="53" facs="52" rend="none"/>cast my whole Existence under the Feet of my Lord, but was so overcome with Ec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stasy that I could not rise. When, look<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing upon me with a Smile of ineffable Graciousness, he approached and took me by the Hand, and, at the Contact, I sprung up a great Height in my Bed, and awoke to Sensations of indescribable Blessedness.</p>
            <p>You are come then, my Lord, my Sal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vation, you are come, my Master! I cried; and I will cling inseparably to you, never, O, never more will I suffer you to depart. Ah, I have felt, severely felt what it is to be without you. For, in your Absence, though but for a Moment, lies the Essence of Hell and Misery; but, in your Presence, my Beloved, in your Presence is Peace un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>speakable, and Joy for ever more!</p>
            <p>From that Day, my Nature became, as it were, wholly inverted. All the Honours and worldly Respects, for which I for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merly risqued my Life, were now my Aversion, and I turned from carnal In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dulgence and Sensuality with Loathing.</p>
            <p>Nothing could now affront, nothing could now offend me. As I totally despised myself, so I wished, after the Process of my divine Master, to be despised and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jected of Men. This made all others, the very meanest of human Creatures, respect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
<pb n="54" facs="53" rend="none"/>unto me. Even in Reprobates, me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thought, I discerned some unerased Traces of the Image and Superscription of my God, and I bowed down before it.</p>
            <p>If Any attempted to injure, or defraud me of my Property, I yielded it without Variance, and thereby I found myself cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dially enriched.</p>
            <p>I grew weary of my own Will and of my own Liberty, and I earnestly prayed my Lord that he would rid me of them, and be, instead thereof, a controuling Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple within me, ever influencing and di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>recting me according to his own Pleasure. Turn me, <hi>Jesus</hi> Master! O turn me, I cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, from all the evil Propensities of my own evil Nature, though thou shou'dst turn me, as thou didst <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> with thy ruling Rein on my Neck, thy Bridle in my Mouth, and thy Hook in my Nose! Take my Heart and Affections captive, and into thine own divine Guidance! compel me into all the Ways and all the Works of thy Commandments; till thy Yoke shall become easy and thy Burden light and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lightsome; till I shall move, as down a Descent, wherever thy Goodness would guide me; till I shall feelingly find and know that all thy Ways are Ways of Pleasantness, and all thy Paths the Paths of Peace!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="54" rend="none"/>
This, my Lord, may look somewhat like Boasting, but it boasteth of Nought, excepting <hi>Christ</hi> crucified, or rather arisen in me, whereby all worldly Matters are crucified unto me.</p>
            <p>Within about a Fortnight after my Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>version, I received a Letter from a Friend in <hi>London,</hi> informing me that my old Un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cle had secretly married a young Creature, who was lately delivered of a Son. That he now openly acknowledged her for his Wife; and that this, as he feared, did not bode me any Good.</p>
            <p>At another Time, these Tidings would have greatly alarmed me; but I was now equally resigned and indifferent to all Events.</p>
            <p>In a few Days after, as I was stepping out of my Lodgings, I was arrested in the Name, and at the Suit of my Uncle, for £.700, the precise Sum for which I had drawn upon him about nine Months be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore. All the Consequences of this Caption immediately occurred to me. I perceived that my Uncle intended to deprive me of my Patrimony, in Favour of his new Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily; and, as I had no Means for opposing his Machinations, save what lay in his own
<pb n="56" facs="55" rend="none"/>Hands, I concluded that a Jail was to be my Portion for Life. Wherefore, I lifted up my Heart and said, within myself, to Prisons and to Death give me chearfully to follow thee, O thou who, in Death, art the Life and Resurrection!</p>
            <p>My Spirit had no sooner uttered this short Ejaculation, than I felt such a Weight of Peace descending upon me, that my Heart leaped within me at the Prospect of Suffering, and I would not have exchanged my Prison for a Throne.</p>
            <p>While I quietly walked with the Officers toward the Place of my Durance, they came to a great Tavern, where they en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tered and proposed to regale themselves at my Expence.</p>
            <p>Mean time, a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant of great Eminence, happened to be, with his Lady, in the principal Room, and, hearing a Bus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle in the House, he enquired the Cause, and sent for the chief Bailiff.</p>
            <p>Soon after, I was conducted into their Presence. They Both rose as I entered; and the Gentleman, approaching, took me familiarly by the Hand and said in <hi>Dutch,</hi> Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> I hear You are in Distress, and that is sufficient to recommend you to my Services; but your Appearance exacts
<pb n="57" facs="56" rend="none"/>Something more from my Inclinations. Pray let me know wherein, and how far it may be requisite for you to command me.</p>
            <p>I muttered Somewhat, as I suppose, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>articulately toward an Answer. For I pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>test, my Lord, I was so struck, so awed, so confounded, by his Presence, that I was lost, for the Time, to the Consideration of my own Affairs. Mean while he placed me at Table just opposite to the heavenly Vision of his Bride, and then went and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sumed his Seat beside her; while I, gazing in Silence and utmost Wonder, recollected those Lines of <hi>Milton</hi> where, speaking of Adam and Eve, he calls them
<q>
                  <l>"the loveliest Pair</l>
                  <l>"That ever since in Love's Embraces met;</l>
                  <l>"<hi>Adam,</hi> the goodliest Man of Men since born</l>
                  <l>"His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters, <hi>Eve."</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentleman perceived my Astonish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, and graciously smiling, again asked me what Sum was requisite to extricate me from my present Difficulty. Ah, Sir, said I, it is a Sum that far exceeds all human Bounty, and, indeed, I would not accept the Obligation from any Man, unless I were assured of being shortly in a Capacity to reimburse him, of which I see no Like<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lihood, I think no Possibility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="57" rend="none"/>
Here I told him, in few Words, how my Father had left me an Infant at the Disposal of my Uncle, who had now put me under Arrest for £.700, which, some time since, he had freely remitted to me, as in my own Right.</p>
            <p>I see, said the Gentleman, your Uncle is a Villain, and means, by casting You in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to Prison, in a strange and distant Place, to deprive you of the Power of bringing him to Account. But he must be detected, it is a Justice which you owe to the Public, as well as yourself. And, as the Amount of the pretended Debt is not sufficient for that Purpose, here is an Order on the Bank in Town for double the Sum. For this you must give me your Note of Hand. Be pleased to reimburse me when it is your Convenience. If that should never happen, be under no Concern; for I hold myself al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ready repaid with Usury, in the Opportu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity of serving an injured and a worthy Man.</p>
            <p>O Sir, I cried, I cannot, indeed I cannot, I will not accept it on any Account. I am patient, nay I am pleased with the Lot that is appointed me. Shall I, in an Instant, break the Yoke and cast the Burden which my gracious Master, but this Instant, has
<pb n="59" facs="58" rend="none"/>laid upon me? No, Sir, I submit myself to it with Thankfulness; I take his Cross to my Bosom and press it to my Heart.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Meekly,</hi> said he, you are a very mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deeming Christian, if you think yourself entitled either to assume or retain your pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>per Crosses at will. There is too much of Self-Righteousness, in such a Zeal, <hi>Meekly.</hi> Humility would rather bid the Will of our Master to be done; and he offers you Enfranchisement by my Hand. Do, my dear Sir, cried the Angel beside him, do, let me petition, let me persuade you to ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cept this little Instance of our good Will to so good a Creature. Though my Lord here has not been able to prevail, a Lady has superior Claims, and I must not be refused.</p>
            <p>Quite sunk, quite overwhelmed, I drop<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ped involuntarily on my Knees before them. Blessed Pair, I exclaimed, blessed and beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>teous beyond Expression; if Angels are like You, what Happiness must be in Hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven! I could no more, my Words were choaked by my rising Emotions.</p>
            <p>My Benefactor then rose, and coming tenderly toward me, he took me warmly in his Arms. My <hi>Meekly,</hi> says he, do not oppress me, I pray you, by this Excess of Acknowledgment; I am but a worthless
<pb n="60" facs="59" rend="none"/>Instrument in the Hands of your Beloved; for from him, and him alone, is every good Gift, and even the Will of the Giver. O, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> added the Lady, her Eyes glittering through Water, we thank you, we cordially thank you, Mr. <hi>Meekly;</hi> you have occasioned us much Pleasure this Day, I assure you; and the Means of our Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness should be delightful in our Eyes.</p>
            <p>My Patron then rung a Bell, and order<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed his principal Gentleman into his Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sence; when, putting the Order into his Hand, here, says he, take this, with the Bailiff, directly to the Bank; there pay him his Demand of £.700 and Fees; and bring me a hundred Pounds in Cash, and the Remainder in Bills on <hi>London.</hi> Then, calling for Pen and Ink, he drew the fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowing short Note, <q>I owe You fourteen hundred Pounds.</q> To which I signed <hi>Charles Meekly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Return of the Messenger, I was put in Possession of the Cash and Bills, and a Dinner of little Elegancies was serv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed up.</p>
            <p>After a short Repast, the Decanters and Glasses being placed, and the Attendants dismissed, my two Patrons gave a loose to social Joy, and invited me to be a Partaker
<pb n="61" facs="60" rend="none"/>in their Festivity. Never was I, nor ever shall I again, be witness to such Flights of Fancy, such a spontaneous Fluency of Heart-springing Glee! with what Pleasure did Erudition cast off its formal Garb! how delightingly did Wisdom assume the Sem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blance and, at Times, the very Phrase of Childhood! they laughed, they rallied me, themselves, and the World. Their Mer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riment was as the Breaking forth and Exu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berance of overflowing Innocence and Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tue. Conceive to yourself, my Lord, a large Room surrounded with Benches, whereon are seated the principal Philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phers, Literati, Lawyers, Statesmen, chief Captains, and chief Conquerors in all Ages; then think you behold two sportively ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>servant Children in the Midst, looking and laughing at the Insignificance of the seve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral Sages; taking off and holding up the Solemnity and Self-importance of each Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fession in Charicature; and setting the whole World, with all its Wisdom, its Toils, and boasted Acquirements, its So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licitudes, Applications, and Atchievements at nought.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman, indeed, pretended, and only pretended, to defend the Sophists, the Valiant, and the Renowned of his Sex; but he evidently exulted in his own Defeat; while the Lady, with a Drollery amazingly
<pb n="62" facs="61" rend="none"/>valuble, ran through the Schools of Philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phy, the Systems of human Policy, and Histories of Heroism, unpluming the Crest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, bringing the Lofty low, and depreciat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing and reducing all Magnitude to Minia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture. And all this She did with an Arch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of such pleasant Meaning; with such Looks, Eyes, and Attitudes of bewitching Transition, as would have infused Fascina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion into old Age and Ugliness; what then must it have done when accompanied by a Beauty that scarce ever was equalled, that could not be exceeded? Did the <hi>Sarah</hi> of the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> resemble her, I wonder not that Nations should have been enamoured of her at the Age of Fourscore.</p>
            <p>At length, the enraptured Husband; no longer able to contain, bent toward her with Looks of Soul-darting Delight, and, restraining his Arms that would have crush<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed her to his Bosom, O, my <hi>Louisa,</hi> he cried, You are too much, too pearly, too precious a Treasure for me! But, giving him a sweetly petulant Pat on the Cheek, away, you Rogue, she said, I'll none of your Mockeries!</p>
            <p>What can Expression add further to this divinely preeminent of human Creatures? whatever was her present Glance, Aspect, or Posture, you would have wished to fix her in it, that you might gaze and admire
<pb n="63" facs="62" rend="none"/>for ever. But, when she varied the En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chantment of her Action and Attitude, you forgot the former Attractions; and She became as it were a Newness of ever rising Delight!</p>
            <p>Alas, how transient, how momentary was the Bliss I then enjoyed! A Chariot and six pied Horses drove up to the Door, attended by a Retinue of ten or twelve Men, All armed, gallantly mounted, and in rich Apparel.</p>
            <p>My dear <hi>Meekly,</hi> mournfully said my Benefactor, I am sorry that we are destined to different Departments. Hodge to night at a Villa belonging to one of my Corres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pondents, and To-morrow we set out to visit some of the <hi>German</hi> Courts. Fare, fare you well, <hi>Meekly,</hi> for a short Season at least!</p>
            <p>I would have east myself at his Feet. It was an Emotion, a Propensity which I could not resist; but he prevented me, by kissing and casting his Arms affectionately about me. The Lady then turned to me, and, with a Smile of Heart-captivating Graciousness, God be with You, God be with You, my good Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> she cried, perhaps we may meet ere long in your own <hi>England.</hi> I answered not, but bending on
<pb n="64" facs="63" rend="none"/>one Knee, I caught her Hand, pressed it fervently to my Lips, and permitted her to depart.</p>
            <p>Alas, they did depart. I saw them for the last Time. They mounted their Car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riage, and being seated, they bent forward, and, bowing to me with a fix'd Regard, off they drove, and tore away with them, as I thought, the best Part of my Soul.</p>
            <p>I followed them with straining Eyes: when out of sight, methought I held them still in view; and I blessed and kissed, in Imagination, the very Ground over which they went. At length I awoke from my Delirium, and with slow and heavy Steps turned back into the House.</p>
            <p>I had not yet, through Shame, so much as enquired the Name of my Benefactor. I therefore called to my Host, in order to inform myself of all that I could learn con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerning him; as also to make out a Bill, for it had not been called for, and I pleased myself with the Thought of discharging a Reckoning that my Friends had forgotten. When I questioned my Host on this Head, he put his Hands to his Sides and broke in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to a violent Fit of Laughter; no, no, Mas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter, said he, there's nothing for any One to pay in this House, I assure You; Myn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>heer never troubles himself about those
<pb n="65" facs="64" rend="none"/>Matters, his Major Domo pays all, ay, and for every Guest too that happens to be in the same Inn with his Master.</p>
            <p>Why pray, said I, is he a Lord? A Lord, quotha? not so little as that comes to nei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther; no Sir, he is a Prince, the very Prince of our Merchants, and our Mer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chants are Princes above all Lords. And pray how do they stile or call him? He has many Names and Titles, when our Tra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders speak of him, they call him Mynheer <hi>Van Glunthong,</hi> but Others stile him my Lord of Merchants, and Others my Lord the Brother-Man, and my Lord the Friend of the Poor.</p>
            <p>The Remainder of my Story is very short, and still more insignificant. I soon set out for <hi>England,</hi> in order to file a Bill against my Uncle, and compel him to disco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver what Patrimony my Father had left me. But God was pleased, in the mean Space, to cut off all Debate; his Wife and Child had died of an epidemic Distemper, and he did not survive them above a Fort<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>night. He left me a penitential Letter, with a small Will enclosed, whereby I be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>came entitled to three hundred a Year in right of my Father, and an additional four Hundred in right of my Uncle, with a Sum of near three thousand Pounds in ready Money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="65" rend="none"/>
If I know my own Heart, the only Cause of rejoicing, that I felt on that Occasion, was that it put it in my Power to discharge my Pecuniary Obligations to my late gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous Preserver. I immediately wrote and transmitted Bills to <hi>Holland</hi> for the Pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, but the Bills were returned, and I could hear no Tidings concerning the Resi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence of my Patron. I then put out his £.1400 on the best Securities that I could procure. It is now close upon five and thirty Years since I saw him; and, in that Time, the Principal, with Interest upon Interest, yearly turned into Capital, has amounted to nearly five thousand Pounds, one Penny of which I never touch, but hold the Whole as sacred.</p>
            <p>Mean Time, it has cost me Hundreds upon Hundreds in Correspondencies, Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vertisements, and even in special Messengers to several Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> to discover where this Greatest, this most eminent of Men could have concealed himself; but alas, my Search proved as fruitless as that of the Miser in hunting after the Pearl of mighty Price!</p>
            <p>During those five and thirty Years, the Image of the Persons of those my two gracious Patrons never left my Memory, were ever at my Heart. Ah, I would say
<pb n="67" facs="66" rend="none"/>to myself, they are dead, they are dead; or rapt, perhaps, like <hi>Ebjah</hi> alive into Heaven; Flesh and Blood, resmed as theirs, might easily pass from its little Impurities, through the Fire of the Love of God, to the Place of its Bliss. And again it was my daily and ardent Petition, that, if their Mortal was not yet swallowed up of Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mortality, I might once set my Eyes upon them before I died.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> ended. — I thank you, my dear Friend, said the Earl, for your History; it has entertained me most pleasingly, and I have also been highly edified by some Passages in it. But, with Respect to the Glimpse that you had of your two wonderful Friends, I think it must have been a Vision, or merely a Matter of Imagination; for, I never saw in Nature, nor read in Fiction of any thing comparable to the Excellencies that you have described in that exalted Pair. If it was a Vision, my Lord, it must have been one of blessed Angels indeed; but I hope you will allow that the Benefits, which they conferred, were no way visio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nary. O, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> said <hi>Harry</hi> with a Sigh, the Picture, that you have drawn of that dear Lady, has almost given me a Distaste to all the rest of her Sex. Ah, might I meet hereafter some Daughter,
<pb n="68" facs="67" rend="none"/>some Descendent, some distant Likeness of her, how happy should I think myself! May Heaven succeed your ominous Wish, my dearest Child, cried <hi>Meekly!</hi> It is just, perhaps prophetic that it should be so. For, never did I see so perfect a Resemblance between any two Creatures, as between the Consort of that bewitching Woman and yourself; it struck me, the other Night, the Moment you enter'd the Room; and I thought that I beheld my very Benefactor newly arisen, like a young <hi>Phoenix,</hi> from the Ashes of old Age.</p>
            <p>Near a Fortnight more elapsed, without any News or Notice from Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> or from the Messenger who was sent dispatch for him. <hi>Harry</hi> daily advanced in the Favour and Familiarity of his Father. And Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> continued with them in a most pleasing Society.</p>
            <p>On a fine Morning, as they were walk<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing together toward the Village, this is the first Time, my <hi>Harry,</hi> said the Earl with a Sigh, that I have ventured to turn my Face this Way, since the Death of my Wife and the Interment of your dear Brother. O my Lord, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> I would gladly exchange my Lot in Life with the meanest of yonder Cottagers, who earns his daily Bred by the Labour of his Hands, provided I might thereby restore
<pb n="69" facs="68" rend="none"/>them Both to your Bosom. Not so, not so, my Son, fervently replied the Earl, I would not lose my <hi>Harry,</hi> tho' I were thereby to resuscitate All that are dead in <hi>England!</hi> I have no Cause, no Manner of Right to complain; I am still happy, wonderfully happy, too happy in the Pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>session of such a Child!</p>
            <p>Just then, a great Shouting and Uproar was heard in the Village. The huge Mastiff, belonging to <hi>Peregrine Pelt</hi> the Tanner, had run mad, and came foaming up the Road, pursued by thirty of the Townsmen, armed with Staves, Spits, and Pitchforks. The Dog rushed on at such a Rate, that there was no Possibility for our Company to escape him; and <hi>Harry,</hi> observing that he made directly toward his Father, threw himself full in his Way. Instantly the envenomed Monster sprung up and cast himself open Mouth upon our Hero; but <hi>Harry,</hi> with a wonderful Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sence of Mind, having wrapped his left Arm in the Skirt of his Coat dashed it into the frothing Jaws of the terrible Animal, when, giving a Trip, at the same Time, to his hinder Legs, he threw him flat on the Ground, and, springing up into the the Air, he descended upon him with all the Force of his Heels, and dashed his Bowels to Pieces; whereupon the Creature
<pb n="70" facs="69" rend="none"/>uttered a faint Howl, sprawled awhile, and expired.</p>
            <p>The Earl and Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> stood, yet a while, pale, astonished, and unassured; and my Lord, looking about in a Pannic, cried, where is the Dog, what's become of the mad Dog? In the mean time the Villagers came on in full Pursuit, crying out, the mad Dog, the mad Dog, take Care of the mad Dog! But, when they All arrived, and beheld their huge Enemy looking formidable even in Death, never was Amazement equal to theirs. They stared at the Earl, <hi>Meekly,</hi> and <hi>Harry,</hi> in Turns; and seeing no Weapon in any of their Hands; God, cried Goodman <hi>Dems<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter,</hi> God has been wonderfully gracious in your Deliverence, my Lord; for nothing less than a Thunderbolt could so suddenly have stricken this Monster dead. I protest, said the Earl, I was so much alarmed that I know not how it happened; I remember nothing further than that my dear Child here thrust himself between his Father and Danger. But I beheld, said <hi>Meekly,</hi> when, with one Stroke of his Arm, he dashed the Creature to the Ground, and then in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly crushed him to death with his Feet. Not I, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> modestly replied <hi>Harry,</hi> God gave me Strength, for the Season, in Defence of my Father. But are you not bit, are you not hurt, my Child, cried
<pb n="71" facs="70" rend="none"/>the Earl, coming up tremblingly to his Son? Not touched, indeed, my Lord. Glory for that in the Highest, exultingly cried the Earl!</p>
            <p>I knew, exclaimed <hi>Tom Truck,</hi> with a Shout and Look of Triumph, I knew it could be no Other but my brave and noble young Master who did the Feat. On my Life, cried Farmer <hi>Felster,</hi> he is able, with his naked Arm, like another young <hi>David,</hi> to save his Lambs from the Jaws of the Lion and the Paws of the Bear.</p>
            <p>Though these Praises served only to put our Hero to Confusion, they went trickling, like Balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> to the Heart of his Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther. <hi>Pelt,</hi> said the Earl, let it be your Task to flea and tan me the Hide of your own Dog. I will have his Skin stuffed with Incense, and his Nails of solid Gold; and he shall hang up in my Hall, from Generation to Generation, to commemorate the Piety and Prowess of my Son! Mean while, my good Friends, I invite you All, with your Families, Kinsfolk, and Neighbours, to come and feast with me this Day. Sorrow hath endured her Night; but Joy cometh, with my Child, and ariseth on us as a new Morning!</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon, all the Towns-Folk and Neighbours, with their Wives and
<pb n="72" facs="71" rend="none"/>Children, convened to the great House, having their Cattle and themselves heavy laden with Faggots, for a magnificent Il<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lumination. The whole Court was spread with Tables, and the Tables with Victuals and Liquors; beside two Hogsheads of <hi>October</hi> that stood apart.</p>
            <p>The Earl, in the Joy for his own Escape, and the recent Prowess of his young Hero, went forth with a chearful Countenance and graciously welcomed all his Guests; where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>at, they wished Health and long Life to his Lordship and their young Lord, and, giving a joint Huzza, sat down to their Banquet. From whence, after a Night far spent in Carousal, their great Fire being out, and their great Hogsheads exhausted, they peacefully helped Each-Other to their respective Homes; regretting, however, that they had not been honoured with the Presence of their young Master among them. For <hi>Harry</hi> had besought his Father to dispense with him, yet awhile, from partaking in any Party or Scene of Festivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, especially when appointed in his own Honour; and Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> highly approved and applauded his Motion.</p>
            <p>On the Eve of the following Day, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> rode abroad on a charitable Visit to a dying Man in the Neighbourhood; and
<pb n="73" facs="72" rend="none"/>my Lord was fondly toying and patting the Cheek of his Darling, as they stood at the Hall Door; when <hi>Harry</hi> spied a mourn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Coach turning up the lower End of the great Avenue, and instantly cried out, there's my Uncle, my Lord, my Uncle, my dearest Uncle! and off he shot like Lightning. The Coach drove but slowly, <hi>Harry</hi> was up with it in a Twinkling, and vaulting in at the Window, was, in the Instant, in the Bosom of his best Friend and Patron.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Earl had retired into the House in great Agitation. He feared and was jealous of the Manner in which his Brother would meet him; and this gave him equal Doubt and Hesitation respecting the Manner in which he ought to receive his Brother. Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> on the other Hand, was not wholly without some similary Emotions; so that, when <hi>Harry</hi> introduced his Uncle into the Par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lour, no two noble Personages could salute Each other with a more distant Respect.</p>
            <p>The Earl, however, on casting a Glance upon the Face of his Brother, felt a Tide of returning Affection, and lifting up his Hands and Eyes, exclaimed, it is he, it is he! my <hi>Harry,</hi> my <hi>Harry Clinton!</hi> my dear, my long lost, my long sought Bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther! then hastened forward, in a Gush of
<pb n="74" facs="73" rend="none"/>Passion, and caught him in his eager Arms. When Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> alternately folding the Earl to his Bosom, cried, I am content, O my God! give me now to depart in Peace, since at last, I find, and feel that I have indeed a Brother!</p>
            <p>Our Hero, observing the Violence of their Emotion, interposed with a gentle Care, and supporting them to Seats, placed them tenderly by each other.</p>
            <p>For a while they Both sat silent, with a Handkerchief at their Eyes; till the Earl turned, and plaintively said, you don't for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>give me, <hi>Harry Clinton;</hi> you never will, you never can forgive me, my Brother! Whereupon, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> caught up the Earl's Hand to his Lips, and, pressing it with a fervent Respect, cried, my Brother and my Lord, my Brother and my Lord!</p>
            <p>O then, said the Earl, you do forgive me, I find; but, never can I, never will I forgive myself. My Faults toward you, my noblest Brother, for these many long Years have been ever before me; my Ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>glects, my Pride and Insolence, my con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>temptuous Treatment of One, so highly my Superior; of my <hi>Harry,</hi> the only Boast and Glory of our House!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="74" rend="none"/>
Mean while, our Hero stood aloof with his Head averted, weeping and sobbing with evident Agitation. Till Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> cried, no more, my Brother, no more, I beseech you! It is already too much; I cannot bear my present Excess of grateful Affection for you; it struggles to rush forth, but Utterance is not given. Beside, we shall break the Heart of our dear Child there; his Nature is too tender to support such a Scene as this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then smilingly turned his Face, toward his Parents, all shining through Tears, as the Sun in a Shower. And ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vancing, and kneeling before them, as they sat; he took the Hands of Each, al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ternately, and pressed them in Silence to his Lips.</p>
            <p>In about an Hour after, while their Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fections were still at the highest, but their Spirits somewhat composed, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> returned. The Earl immediately rose, and advancing, took him by the Hand with a cordial Familiarity. Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> says he, I shall now have the Pleasure of introducing you to that inestimable Bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther of whom you have heard me speak so often; Brother, this is Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> my best and worthiest Friend!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="75" rend="none"/>
Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> rose and advanced; and <hi>Meekly</hi> approached with an abased Reve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rence, not venturing to look up, but saluted him, as he would have saluted an Angel of Light!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meekly, Meekly,</hi> cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I have surely heard that Name before! Pray, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> were you ever abroad? have you travelled, Sir? were you ever in <hi>Holland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Meekly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, <hi>Meekly</hi> started, as awaked by the Sound of a Voice, whose recollected Tune<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings went thrilling to his Heart; and lifting up his Eyes, and beholding the Traces of Features, once so lovely, and ever deeply endeared to his Memory; he started, and staggering back some Steps, he sunk down on a Chair behind him, al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most in a fainting Fit.</p>
            <p>The Earl, greatly alarmed, went up, and taking him by the Hand, what is the Matter, my Friend, says he? are you taken suddenly ill, are you not well, my <hi>Meekly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O, my Lord — he pantingly cried — there he is — as sure as I live — my Patron — my Benefactor — the wondrous Man that I told you of — there
<pb n="77" facs="76" rend="none"/>he stands, in his own precious Person be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore us!</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> then approached, and, tak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing a Seat beside him, leaned toward him with a melting Complacence. Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> said he, I expected ere this to have em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>braced you in Heaven; but I rejoice to meet you even on Earth; for I have ever re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained a very affectionate Impression of you; and I more especially rejoice to meet you in the present Society.</p>
            <p>But then — but then you come alone — you come alone, my Lord and Mas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter! — Alas, you wipe your Eye! — O then, it must be so! — And here he broke into a passionate Gush of Tears.</p>
            <p>My Lord and our Hero, hereupon, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>collecting the engaging Circumstances of a Character, on whose Description they had been so lately enamoured, could not refuse their Tribute to the Memory of that admirable Lady, to whose Person they now found themselves endearingly attached by Affinity.</p>
            <p>At length Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> distressed to the last Degree for the Distress in which he saw the forlorn <hi>Meekly,</hi> sweetly turned from his own Affliction to the Consoling of that
<pb n="78" facs="77" rend="none"/>Friend whom he found so deeply afflicted for him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> says he, let us not weep for the Living, but rather for the Dead! for those who are yet in the Vale of Mor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tality. Shall we mourn the Condition of Angels, shall we lament that a Weight of Glory is fallen on those whom we loved? No, let us rather rejoice in the Prospect of being speedily Partakers!</p>
            <p>When Supper was over, <hi>Harry</hi> laid hold of the first Interval of Converse, to en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quire after his Friends in Town, more especially Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> his <hi>Arabella,</hi> and their little <hi>Dicky.</hi> They are come, said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> to sudden and great Affluence. Old <hi>Clement</hi> is thoroughly reconciled to his Son, and is doatingly fond of <hi>Arabella</hi> and her Child. I am glad of it with all my Heart, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> clapping his Hands; but pray, how did this Matter come about, Sir? By an Event, my Dear, in which the Arm of Providence was signally visi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble. But, before I say how it came to pass, you ought to give our Company a short History of this worthy Family, they will then become interested in their Suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cess.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="78" rend="none"/>
               <hi>Harry,</hi> willingly and gracefully, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formed the Task enjoined him; and then his Uncle proceeded.</p>
            <p>The second Day after you lest me, a Man of a genteel Appearance, but pale and bleeding, was carried, stretched on a Door, by some of our charitable Townsmen, and brought to my House. I was then a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>broad with <hi>Clement</hi> on a Visit to your old Friend <hi>Vindex;</hi> but the Stranger was in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly admitted; and, while some of the Servants rode off for a Surgeon, others tenderly undressed and put him into a warmed Bed.</p>
            <p>Soon, after I had returned and was in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formed of what had passed, the Surgeon arrived, and, putting five Guineas in his Hand, I desired him to attend his Patient and bring me Word of his Estate. In Half an Hour he came forth and, shaking his Head, said, our Patient, Sir, will not do. He is wounded in the Groin with a Pistol Bullet. The Ball has got within the Abdomen, my Instruments will not reach it, and, if it has entered the Viscera, he will die of Convulsions in less than three Hours. I have accordingly told the Gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tleman what I thought of him, and advised him immediately to settle his worldly Affairs. He tells me his Name is <hi>Saint-Belial,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="79" rend="none"/>and he requested me, as soon as I reached <hi>London,</hi> to send Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> to him, who lives over against the blue Posts on the Strand.</p>
            <p>The Name of <hi>Clement</hi> made me curious to know who the Party was, and, entering his Chamber, I took a Chair and sat down softly by the Side of his Bed. But, the Moment that I cast my Eye on his Visage, I shrunk inward at the Shock; for all the Malignity and Horrors of Hell were jointly legible on his Countenance.</p>
            <p>Humanity, however, compelled me to address him. I am sorry to hear, Sir, said I, that you are not for this World, but I trust that your Hope looks forward to a better Home. I have no Hope, said he, save such as my Faith has been, that, since I must die, I shall die wholly.</p>
            <p>I protest, I was so stunned and disconcert<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed by the Words and Looks of the Man, that I found no Answer, and he proceeded.</p>
            <p>As I have no further Concern with this World, I have sent for an old Gentleman with whom I had some Connections, and resolve to do an Act of Justice before I die, the only One that ever I did during my Life-time. For, your Charity, and that of your People, has half frightened me in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to
<pb n="81" facs="80" rend="none"/>a Notion, that there may be something of that, which is called Goodness, upon Earth; and then how fearful, how tremen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dous must my Situation be! Wherefore, as old <hi>Clement</hi> may not arrive in Season, I will, with your Permission, inform you of such Things as concern him. For, as I have nothing to hope, through all Eternity, nei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther have I any thing to fear on this Side of it.</p>
            <p>My Father's Name was <hi>Belcher Saint-Belial.</hi> He was an under Retainer to the Law, and raked up a little Fortune by side<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>long Practices; so that he grew ambitious of preferring me, his only Child, to the Bar, and, in that View, sent me to School, and from School to <hi>Oxford</hi> College. But, I ought to have began my History ear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lier.</p>
            <p>If there are Devils, I surely had One be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore I saw the Light, and was filled with the evil Spirit from my Mother's Womb; insomuch that my Nurse died of a Cancer in her Breast occasioned by the envenomed Bites I gave her Nipple, with my toothless Gums, while she suckled me.</p>
            <p>While an Infant, I took a heart-felt Pleasure in dismembering Flies and impale<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Worms alive upon Pins; and, when
<pb n="82" facs="81" rend="none"/>at School, I was the Promoter of all Parties for worrying and torturing Cats and Dogs to death. But my principal Amusement lay in catching and fleaing Frogs, in seeing them spring about in the Rage of their Pains, and so leaving them to perish in un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>utterable Anguish.</p>
            <p>As I grew in Stature, I grew also in the Strength of my Malignity. Evil became my Good. My Enjoyments lay in the Loss, Damage, and Detriment of Others. I conceived a Kind of envious Hate against Those who had done me a Benefit. I re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quited open Friendship with hidden Male<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>volence; and I cannot remember that ever I felt a Sense of any thing that goes by the Name of Gratitude, Humanity or Virtue.</p>
            <p>I usually carried about me a walking Stick or Cane, in the hollow Part of which an Iron Spike was contained, which I could cause to spring forth with a Shake of my Arm, and again return to its Case, at Pleasure. With this, as I strolled the Fields, which I often did for the Purpose, I stabbed the Cattle of the Neighbours in the Belly or Fundament, and chuckled to see them leap, and kick, and plunge about in their Agonies. In short, I drew to my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self a Kind of Comfort from a Comparison with the Miseries that I inflicted on other Creatures; and, had the Elements been at
<pb n="83" facs="82" rend="none"/>my Controul, nothing but Pest and Hurri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cane, Distemper and lingering Death should have arisen and prevailed throughout the State of Nature.</p>
            <p>At the College I got acquainted with one <hi>Clement,</hi> a gentle tempered but weak Lad, of whom I made a Property. And I pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vailed upon him to turn away several of his Servants, under Colour of their having stollen the Cash, Books, and other Effects, of which I had secretly plunder'd him.</p>
            <p>At length I had private Intelligence that my Father had been pilloried for Forgery and other double handed Dealings; that he had died of the Bruises which he re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived on the Execution of his Sentence; and that his Effects had been seized by a Variety of Claimants. Wereupon, with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out taking any Notice of my Father or Family, I made my shortest way to <hi>Lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don,</hi> with All that I could borrow or lay a light Hand upon among my Acquain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance.</p>
            <p>The first Thing I did, at the City, was to wait upon old <hi>Clement,</hi> the Father of my Friend, with a forged Draught upon him for a hundred Pounds; on the Sight of which, he so fretted, and exclaimed, and walked about in such Perturbation, that
<pb n="84" facs="83" rend="none"/>I greatly feared I had overshot my Mark. At length, however, he laid me down the Money, but catching up a Book, swore that it was the last Penny his Son should re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive from him for six Months to come.</p>
            <p>He then began to question me touching the Character of the young Gentleman, and, under Colour of praising him for Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticles to which I perceived the old Man had an Aversion, I exasperated him to such a Degree, that he again swore he would hold no further Correspondence with him, until he should be fully assured of his Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formation.</p>
            <p>Having thus effectually cut off all Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce between my Friend and his Father, I cast aside my Fears of being suddenly brought to Account for my late Acquisiti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on. I was even so daring as to take Lodg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings the very next Door, where I got in League with a young Woman of a most seducing Face and Person, but whose Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fligacy of Manners was, artfully, covered by the most artless Appearance of shame<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>faced Innocence that ever graced the feigned Character of any Actress, on any Stage.</p>
            <p>She did not attempt, however, to im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose upon me, for kindred Minds, like Ours, instantly saw into Each Other; and
<pb n="85" facs="84" rend="none"/>we soon concerted a Plan for her marrying Goodman <hi>Clement,</hi> and dividing the Spoils of the old Miser between us.</p>
            <p>This we easily brought about, and never was Man so happy, in being so imposed upon, while I shared with him in the Pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>session of his Purse and his Bride.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as I had promised to procure him Intelligence concerning his Son, I produced several forged Letters from pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended Correspondents in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taining such Accounts of the Galantries and other Extravagancies of young <hi>Clement,</hi> as wholly alienated his Father's Affections from him, and he sent him a final Note, whereby he discarded him from his Fortune for ever.</p>
            <p>About two Years thus passed, in the full Enjoyment of All that could glut Flesh and Blood; though, in order to ingratiate my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self with the old Man, I appeared to him the most frugal and abstemious of Mankind. But, one Night, while Mrs. <hi>Clement</hi> and I sat together, indulging ourselves in the Hope that the good Man had been knock<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed on the Head, or had fallen dead of an Apoplexy; He was brought to us in a Chair, pale and wounded, and told us that he should have been certainly murdered, had he not, by the most wonderful Provi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence,
<pb n="86" facs="85" rend="none"/>met with his Son, who bravely knocked down the Robber and happily de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>livered him; and that he had given him what Cash he had about him, with a Note for £. 500, on the Bank.</p>
            <p>All in a Pannic, and thunderstruck as I was by this News, I yet pretended to con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gratulate him on the Return of his Son to Duty, but advised him to Bed directly for the Recovery of his Health and Spirits.</p>
            <p>The Remainder of the Night, I walked about, agonizing, and racking my Brain for some Expedient to divert the instant Ruin that impended, when a sudden Thought started, or was rather infused into me, and, at Dawn of Day, I went to an Agent, who had done several Jobbs for me, of no very laudable Tendency.</p>
            <p>When I had given him his Lesson, and put twenty Guineas into his Hand, he has<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tily went and desired to see Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> on Business of great Consequence, when, fall<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing on his Knees, he confessed, with ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pearing Penitence, that he was the Person who had wounded him the foregoing Night; that he did not intend to hurt him so much, but that young Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> had hired him for the Purpose, and lay in wait hard by, in order that he might appear to come in to his Rescue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="86" rend="none"/>
This Tale was so feasible, that the old Man swallowed it, as a greedy Fish swallows the Bait that, at the same time, conveys the Barb into his Bowels. He thereupon had me called to him in a Hurry, told me what he had discovered, and gave me an Order to stop Payment of the £.500, with a hasty Note to be left at the Bank for his Son.</p>
            <p>On the Way, I recollected an Advertise<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment in the public Papers that offered a large Reward for the Caption of one <hi>Ara<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bella Clement,</hi> who had been guilty of the Murder of the late Lord <hi>Stivers;</hi> and it in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly occurred to me that She was proba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bly the Wife of my quondam Friend and Patron. Wherefore, as soon as I had dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>patched my Business at the Bank, I ran and collected a Number of Constables, and waited with them aloof, till I saw the Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject, whom I dreaded and detested above Plague and Poison, enter and return dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>contented from the Counting-House. We then dogged him at a Distance till we saw him safe lodged and, following softly up Stairs, we demanded a Woman who stood before us for our Prisoner.</p>
            <p>Young <hi>Clement</hi> then, all enraged, exert<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed himself with wonderful Action and In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trepidity. With one Stroke of a Poker, he
<pb n="88" facs="87" rend="none"/>tore off my right Ear and cleft my Shoul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der to the Bone; then drove us All down Stairs, though several Shot were fired at him.</p>
            <p>What happened to him afterward I knew only from Report, for I lay ill of my Wounds for several Months together, and on my Recovery, could learn no Tidings concerning him.</p>
            <p>In the mean Space, my continual Fears of his Appearance made my Life extremely miserable. My Paramour and I had often Thoughts and Consultations touching the Expediency of making away with the old Gentleman; but it occurred to us that young <hi>Clement</hi> might still be alive and, on the Death of his Father, might bring us to a severe Account for his Substance.</p>
            <p>At length, about six Weeks ago, as I returned from transacting an Affair at <hi>St. Albans,</hi> I met, and instantly recognized my old Enemy, walking with a young Gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tleman, about a Mile above this Town. Immediately I stopped, and, pulling my Hat over my Eyes, pray Gentlemen, said I, am I on the right Road to <hi>London?</hi> for I have travelled far, and fear I may have gone astray. You are on the direct Road, said the Lad, but if you choose to stop short, you
<pb n="89" facs="88" rend="none"/>are heartily welcome to a Lodging with us for the Night. Why, Gentlemen, said I, do you live in yonder Town? We do, said <hi>Clement.</hi> In that Answer I had all the In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>telligence I desired, and away I spurred.</p>
            <p>From that Time, scarce a Day passed wherein I did not take an Airing on the same Road, still expecting and panting to meet my Adversary. I rode armed with one Case of Pistols before me, and Another in my Pockets; and I determined, though I should meet <hi>Clement</hi> in the Midst of a hun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dred Men, to shoot him directly through the Head, and trust to the Speed of my Horse for my Escape. But, this Day, as I returned near the farther End of the Town, a white Goat, pursued by a Dog, rushed suddenly through a Hedge, whereupon my Horse plunged, and one of the Pistols that was ready cocked in my Wastcoat Poc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ket went off, and reduced me to the Condi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion in which you behold me.</p>
            <p>His last Words were scarce intelligible. He was seized with Convulsions and lay speechless near two Hours. At length old <hi>Clement</hi> arrived; his Servants helped him out of his Coach; I met him in the Hall, and led him into the Parlour.</p>
            <p>There, being both seated, I succinctly gave him the Heads of <hi>Saint Belial</hi>'s His<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tory.
<pb n="90" facs="89" rend="none"/>When, looking earnestly at me, you appear, Sir, said he, to be much of the Gentleman, but, if you were an Angel, I would credit nothing against the Honesty of that good Young Man; and least of all to the Prejudice of the dear young Innocent that I have married.</p>
            <p>I confess I was somewhat piqued at this sudden Rebuff; but, suppressing the Ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dency that I had to Resentment, I wish, said I, you had come Time enough to be present at the unhappy Man's Confession, but it may yet please God to open your Eyes to your own Wrongs before he ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pires.</p>
            <p>So saying, I conducted him to the Room where the Wretch lay, to all Appearance, insensible. I then recollected an approved Elixir that I had in my Closet, and sending for it, I infused a Tea-spoon full, Drop by Drop, into his Mouth.</p>
            <p>In a Quarter of an Hour he came perfect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly to his Senses, and, turning his languid Eyes toward the old Man, You are come then, said he, to hear my dying Words. — I forged the Note for which you gave me a hundred Pounds — I forged all the Letters that you received to your Son's Prejudice — I was the Father of the Child which the Strumpet, with whom
<pb n="91" facs="90" rend="none"/>you live, brought into the World — She is not your Wife — She is Wife to <hi>Caleb Cable</hi> the Boatswain, who lives by the Monument. — He has got Hundreds of your Money for keeping Counsel — It was, in truth, your Son who rescued you from the Hands of the Robber — I forged the Tale, and bribed the Man who deceived you in that Matter — Often, as you lay in Bed, <hi>Moll Cable</hi> has urged me to dispatch you before Morning — Had I murdered your Son, as I long since intended, you should not have survived him four and twenty Hours. —</p>
            <p>Here, turning his eager and ghastly Visage upon me, O Sir, said he, is there, is there, for certain, a Judgment to come? Alas! I answered, Death, Judgment, Hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven, and Hell, are the four capital Things of which the Universe affords the highest and deepest Assurance. O, then, he cried, I am going, down! down! down!</p>
            <p>This he spoke with all the visible Hor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rors and Desperation, conceivable in <hi>Judas,</hi> when just about fixing the Rope to his Neck; and, lapsing into his last Agonies, he soon after expired.</p>
            <p>All pale and astonished, the old Gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man sat silent and panting; and, seeing he
<pb n="92" facs="91" rend="none"/>was about to faint, I ordered some Drops and Water, with a Bottle of Wine, while I supported him from falling.</p>
            <p>When he was somewhat restored, and had recovered his Speech, he laid hold on my Hand and said, I beg your Pardon, Sir, I would do it, if I were able, upon my Knees. But, who could have thought this?—I wish that I had indeed been murdered—I would that I had died, before I was thus undeceived in the only Objects of my Love.—Alas, Sir, I have now no Relation, no Kindred, no Friend except yourself upon Earth. All Others are equally Plunderers and Murderers in my Eyes.—These Words were inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rupted by a Flood of Tears.</p>
            <p>Having consoled him in the kindest Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner I could, Word was brought that Din<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner was served, and I led him, partly by Constraint, to the Table; but whispered private Orders that <hi>Arabella</hi> and her <hi>Dickey</hi> should not appear, for <hi>Clement</hi> staid to dine with his Friend <hi>Vindex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Dinner and three Glasses, which was all I could force upon him, I remon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strated the Expediency of his immediate Return, to secure his Effects; lest all should be spirited away upon any Intimati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on of the present Accident. Ah, Sir, said
<pb n="93" facs="92" rend="none"/>he, I shall scarce, I fear, be able to bear the Sight of a Place in which I so long thought myself so very happy; but if you will be so gracious as to accompany me I will venture. I will, said I, on Condition, that you engage to return and sleep here this Night.</p>
            <p>Early in the Afternoon we arrived at his House, in my Coach, attended by his two Servants and Four of mine, well arm<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed. As we entered the Parlour, his sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed Wife rose in an Alarm that she evi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dently endeavoured to suppress. What is the Matter, Lovee? said she, advancing; for what did <hi>Saint Belial</hi> send to you? it became him much better to have attended on You, methinks. I fear my Lovee is sadly tired. But, pray, what did he want with you? To tell me, answered old <hi>Cle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,</hi> that he was a dying Man, that I was a Dupe and a Cuckold, and that you were a Strumpet.</p>
            <p>O fye, Lovee, said she, those are very naughty Names; but you cannot be in earnest.</p>
            <p>Step, said he, and enquire of <hi>Caleb Cable</hi> the Boatswain; tell him, at the same time, that I cannot afford to maintain his Wife any longer, and that he has seen the very last of his hush Money. Ah, <hi>Polly, Polly,</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="93" rend="none"/>he continued, meltingly, all this I could almost away with; but Murder is a fright<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful Thing; who could think that my <hi>Polly</hi> would murder her old Man?</p>
            <p>O then, she cried, I see that the Villain has betray'd me. I see that I'm undone. My Youth and Beauty cast away, my Arts and Time spent in vain! Why, you doat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, driveling Wretch, your Fortune was little enough to compensate the Pains I took in disguising my Aversion to you. But, you shall not live to triumph in my Disappointment.</p>
            <p>So saying, she sprung forward and, grasping his Neck in both her Hands, he instantly grew black in the Face, his Eyes rolled, his Jaws expanded, and he must have expired on the Spot. But I stepped hastily to her and, seizing both her Wrists, I gave them a sudden Wrench, whereupon she loosed her Hold, shouting out that her Arms were broke, and throwing herself, groaning, into a Chair, she called for in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant Perdition on me, the crazy Dotard, herself, and all the World.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the old Gentleman had sunk panting to the Floor. But, rais<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing him gently, I placed him on a large Sofa, where he began to respire with Free<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="94" rend="none"/>
I then sent for a Sergeant at Mace and his Attendants, and giving our Heroine, with a Mittimus into his Hands, I desired him to provide her with a decent Room and suitable Accommodations, and not to admit any Company, except her Servant, till further Orders. Ay, away with her, away with her, at any Rate! exclaimed the old Man, she has the Looks of a very <hi>Gor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gon,</hi> and every Hair of her Head is turned into a frightful Serpent.</p>
            <p>As soon as she was gone, I called her principal Maid and, putting a few Pieces into her Hand, I desired her to follow her Mistress and to serve her with Care and Tenderness; and further to intimate to her that, when she gave any Proofs of Repen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance and Reformation, she should yet be humanely and generously provided for.</p>
            <p>Having thus far settled Matters, I gave Commission to <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> with a male Domestic in whom the old Man con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fided, to remain and take care of the House and Effects; and, taking the Keys of the Cabinets with us, we set off on our return to <hi>Hamstead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Way, Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> grew deeply dejected, and sighing said, O Sir, how
<pb n="96" facs="95" rend="none"/>strong, how very strongly is the Desire of Society impressed on the human Heart; when, even in the Absence of Robbers and Murderers, I feel a Want and Disconsolati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on that I cannot express. I have now no Relation, no Friend but Yourself, no Kin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dred or Connection with any Other upon Earth. To You, indeed, I owe my Life, and all else that I am worth; and, if you will not chase me from You, if you will allow me to remain with You, You shall be all the World to me, the Heir and sole Possessor of all that I possess.</p>
            <p>But, have You not a Son? I cannot think I have, said he; it is now above eight Years since I set Eyes on my dear <hi>Hammel,</hi> the precious Pearl whom, in my Dotage, I madly cast away. But, were he still living, after what is past, I could never more have the Courage to look him in the Face. A cruel and a false Pelican have I proved to my Little One; instead of fostering him with my Vitals, I have with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>held and torn from him even the common Means of Life.</p>
            <p>Do you know None of your Name, said I, who may claim your Substance under Co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lour of being of your Blood? Not Any, Sir; my Father was a Foreigner, and I never heard of any Other of the Name in this Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="96" rend="none"/>
There is One of your Name, said I, who lives in our Town. But then, he is in flowing Circumstances, quite above the Desire of encreasing his Fortune by base or low Means. He is my most intimate Friend, a very accomplished Gentleman, and has one of the finest Women to Wife, and two of the loveliest Children that I have seen. If you please, I will invite and introduce them to You, to Night, or to Morrow.</p>
            <p>On our Arrival, I left old <hi>Clement</hi> a while in the Parlour, while I stepped to give pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vate Directions respecting the Conduct of your Tutor, <hi>Harry,</hi> and the Interview which I proposed between him and his Father.</p>
            <p>Sir, said I as I returned, I have taken the Liberty to invite your Namesakes to sup with You. They are a very amiable Family, and I hope that their Company and Acquaintance will prove a Matter of Consolation, perhaps a Blessing to You. Ah, he cried, my Claims are of a very dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent Nature; I have no Right to Blessings or Consolations of any Kind.</p>
            <p>Some time before Supper, a Rapping was heard, and <hi>Arabella</hi> enter'd, leading in a little Daughter of about four Years
<pb n="98" facs="97" rend="none"/>old, and followed by her Son, <hi>Dickey,</hi> All elegantly dressed.</p>
            <p>Madam, said I, this is a Namesake of Yours, my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> pray let me have the Pleasure of intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ducing You to each Other.</p>
            <p>When they were both seated, the old Gentleman took out his Perspective, and, peering at her for some Time, ah, he cried, what lovely Faces there are in the World, but All have not proved lovely throughout, like You, Madam.</p>
            <p>He then called <hi>Dickey</hi> to him, and tak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing him by both Hands, and bringing him forward between his Knees; what is your Name, my Dear, says he? <hi>Richard Clement,</hi> Sir, so please You. I would it were <hi>Bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tholomew,</hi> replied the old Gentleman; but Names signify nothing, You are a sweet little Fellow, and perhaps may be something the better for my Death. I would not wish your Death, Sir, said <hi>Dickey,</hi> for All that I could get by You. O, how very hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venly, exclaimed the old Man, how hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venly is the Simplicity and Disinterestedness of Infants!</p>
            <p>He next requested <hi>Arabella</hi> to spare her little Daughter to him, for a Minute; and she accordingly took and led her to him:
<pb n="99" facs="98" rend="none"/>When, fondly caressing her, and seating her on his Knee, Could you find in your Heart, says he, to love such an ugly old Thing as I am? Yes, me could, says she, and me has got some Comforts for you in my Pocket. Whereupon she produced a little Paper and, unfolding it, presented him with some candied Seeds and Almonds. O, my God, cried the old Man, what a Heaven I should yet enjoy upon Earth, could I but purchase the Society of these dear Infants!—I heard him, with a moistening Eye, and rejoiced in the ripen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Fruits of my little Project.</p>
            <p>Pray, Madam, says I, what is become of our good Friend your Husband, are we not to have the Happiness of his Company to Night? Sir, says she, he was engaged on indispensable Business at the Time, but will certainly attend you before Supper.</p>
            <p>She had scarce spoke when a second Rap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ping was heard, and in came our <hi>Hammel,</hi> not in gay but costly Apparel, as I had ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>On introducing the Son, to his venera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble Father, they respectfully saluted Each other as utter Strangers. For, our pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent <hi>Hammel</hi> was more different from the meagre and threadbare <hi>Hammel</hi> that his
<pb n="100" facs="99" rend="none"/>Father had last seen, then <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s fat Kine could be from his lean Ones.</p>
            <p>During Supper, and after, I purposely threw out occasional Topics, and gave se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veral Opens, wherein I knew that <hi>Hammel</hi> could shine; and he accordingly made Use of them with great Spirit and Advantage.</p>
            <p>His Father gazed at him with a respect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful Admiration, and at length exclaimed, You are an Ornament, an Honor, Sir, to your Name, to your Lineage, and the Country wherein you were born. But pray of what Family? Alas, Sir, you add Stings to the Recollection of my Faults this Day: I once had a Son, a Son who, in an humble Degree, might now have resembled your<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self; but my Unkindness must, long since, have broken his gentle Heart. My Child saved me from Murderers, and I in Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn was the Murderer of my Child. O, <hi>Hammel,</hi> my <hi>Hammel,</hi> my Son, my Son <hi>Hammel,</hi> would to God I had died be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore I wronged thee! Would God I had died for thee, O <hi>Hammel,</hi> my Son, my Son!</p>
            <p>His last Words were broken and nearly suppressed by a Gush of Tears; when the tender hearted <hi>Hammel</hi> turned an Eye upon me, and cried, O, Sir, we have gone too far! — Then, hastily advancing, he threw
<pb n="101" facs="100" rend="none"/>himself at the Knees of his Father. I am here, Sir, he cried, your <hi>Hammel,</hi> your own <hi>Hammel,</hi> in all Duty and Affection, submissive and prostrate before you.</p>
            <p>You my <hi>Hammel,</hi> are you my <hi>Hammel,</hi> asked the old Man? Ah, had you but his famished Face and his tattered Garment, I would take you to my Arms, to my Heart, into my Vitals.</p>
            <p>O, my Father, cried <hi>Hammy,</hi> look not so strange and wild upon me! I am indeed your Child, once the Darling of your Heart, whom you fostered so tenderly, and nur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tured at School and College; the true Son of your true Wife, look upon me, my Father! You often told me that I was her Picture; do you not see the very Fea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures of my dear Mother in my Face?</p>
            <p>Yes, yes, I think I do.—But then I have been mightily imposed upon of late. I would you were leaner and worse clad, my Child! however, if you come in the Name of my Son, I also will kneel down and crave his Pardon and your Pardon?</p>
            <p>Here the old Gentleman sunk down up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on his Knees, and poor <hi>Hammel,</hi> starting up at the same instant, cried aloud, Alas! Sir, he is beside himself, and I too shall go distracted!</p>
         </div>
         <div n="102-204" type="pages">
            <pb n="102" facs="101" rend="none"/>
            <p>I then was grieved at Heart for the Stra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tagem I had made Use of, to connect this worthy Family the more endearingly toge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther. And coming soothingly to him, and raising him in my Arms, I replaced him in his Seat, and said, believe me, trust to me, my dear Mr. <hi>Clement;</hi> this is your true Child, your only Child, your true <hi>Hammel!</hi> He has lived with me many Years, I can prove him to be your's by a thousand Wit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nesses, by those who can witness what he has suffered, on account of being your Son.</p>
            <p>Well, well, well, said he, whisperingly, it does not signify much, for I have ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther One coming, my <hi>Polly</hi> is now in the ninth Week of her Reckoning.—Ay, but, that <hi>Saint Belial,</hi> who knows but the Child may be an Imp of his Begetting?—A cursed Couple they are, I'm sure; she a Succubus, and he the Devil himself incarnate—I hope they didn't hear me—shut the Door!—O, there they are!—Save me, save me!—they come upon me!—My Throat, they gripe my Throat!—My Breath, my Breath!—O—h—</p>
            <p>Here he swooned. But, on taking a little Blood, he came to himself. So I or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dered
<pb n="103" facs="102" rend="none"/>all to be kept quiet about him; and, getting him to Bed, he swallowed a sopo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rific Draught, slept soundly till Morning, and awoke in his perfect Senses.</p>
            <p>I then went to bid him Good-morrow, and took a Chair by his Bedside.—That was a mighty agreeable Family, said he, who supped with you last Night, Sir. The very worthiest, I replied, that I know upon Earth.—You called them <hi>Clement,</hi> I think.—That is their Name, Sir.—Pray, did they go Home?—No, they are here still; at Times, we make but one Family and one Household.</p>
            <p>While I spoke, I was surprised to see <hi>Clement</hi> enter, dressed in the same shabby Clothes in which we first found him, <hi>Harry;</hi> and the old Gentleman, turning his Head to the Door, started up in his Bed and cried, if I am a living Man, that is surely my <hi>Hammel,</hi> my very Son <hi>Hammel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On hearing this, poor <hi>Clement</hi> leaped hastily forward and, falling by the Bed, seized One of his Father's Hands, repeat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>edly kissed it, and wept upon it. You are restored to me then, he cried, my Father, my Father! God be praised, God be prais<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed! You are restored to me entire, I trust, with all that paternal and melting Fond<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness which was once the Blessing and the
<pb n="104" facs="103" rend="none"/>Treasure that I prized above the World. No, <hi>Hammy,</hi> said the old Man, I will not deceive you, I cannot love you as I once loved you, because you never can forgive me. If you could forgive me, <hi>Hammy,</hi> I would love you with a double Love, a Love passing the Love of Fathers.</p>
            <p>O, my Father, exclaimed <hi>Hammel,</hi> this one happy Moment of Reconciliation am<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply cancels all Offences, and outweighs all Sufferings. Permit me then, my dear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est Father, to introduce Those to you who have an equal Right to your Blessing.</p>
            <p>So saying, off he went, and brought in <hi>Arabella,</hi> with her attending Children, and all the Four kneeled down by the Side of the old Man.</p>
            <p>O, my God, he cried out, you are too bountiful, too gracious, you oppress, you crush me to nothing with this exceeding Weight of your Benefits! I was a withered and a blasted Branch, and you have caused me, like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod to Bud and Blossom anew, and to bear these blessed Fruits, I trust, to your Glory!</p>
            <p>When Breakfast was laid, and the old Gentleman dressed, I sent up for him, and when we were seated, <hi>Clement</hi> entered with
<pb n="105" facs="104" rend="none"/>his Family, All elegantly dressed, as on the preceding Night. <hi>Hammy,</hi> said I, how came you by that Disguise which you put on this Morning? You looked so unlike your<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self you almost frightened me.—Don't you remember that Dress, Sir?—How should I remember what I never saw be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore?—O, you did see them before, Sir; those were the Weeds I wore, when you saved me and Mine from famishing; and I have ever since preserved, and shall ever preserve them, as the precious Memo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rial of my Obligations to you. What, ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>claimed the old Gentleman, my Life, and your Life! has he saved your Life also, my Son? Yes, Sir, cried the grateful Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, All who are alive here live only by—Here, while I put one Hand to the Mouth of my Friend, his venerable Father seized hold on the Other, and, bending one Knee, he pressed it to his Lips, in a Silence that passed all possible Utterance.</p>
            <p>But pray, Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> said I, to turn aside the Subject, what do you propose to do with Mrs. <hi>Cable?</hi> You know that, in Case of Penitence, I promised to have her taken Care of. To be sure, Sir, said he, I will make good all your Engagements, and I will further do whatever she desires, on Condition of her residing in a different Country, or rather in a different Kingdom; for I would not, for the World, that she
<pb n="106" facs="105" rend="none"/>should come within the Reach of me, by fifty Leagues at least; unless you were al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways to be with me for a Safeguard.</p>
            <p>I laughed, and, immediately, Mrs. <hi>Cable</hi>'s Maid entered all in a Heat, with a fright<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ened and imploring Countenance. So my good Girl, said I, how is your Mistress, to Day? Ah Sir! she cried, I have but a very sad Account to give you of my Commission. My Mistress is dead, and I doubt that I, myself, have been ignorantly her Mur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derer.</p>
            <p>Soon, after she was shewn to her Apart<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, <hi>Hetty,</hi> says she, I find myself grow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing very sick, pray step and bring me the little Bottle of Cordial, that you will find standing in such a Corner of my Closet. I did as I was ordered and, returning in all Haste, I presented her with the Bottle. When, looking mournfully at it, and giv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing a heavy Sigh, Ay, she cried, this is the right Cordial, this will do the Business; then calling for a Wine Glass, she filled and drank it off.</p>
            <p>In a little while after, she complained of being drowsy, whereupon I undressed and helped her to Bed, and lighting a Can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dle, I sat down to watch beside her. For a Time, she appeared to sleep quite sound and easy, but again, began to moan and
<pb n="107" facs="106" rend="none"/>toss the Clothes. In a while after, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever, she seemed quite composed. But, toward the Dead of Night, not hearing her breathe, I held up the Candle, and saw that her fine Face was livid and ghastly, and her Skin all discoloured.</p>
            <p>I then thought that I, myself, should have dropped dead on the Spot. I gave a great Shriek, and, I believe, continued shrieking till the Keeper and a Servant Maid came in. So Sir, if your Honour is pleased to think that the Blame of this Matter belongs to me, I am come to deliver my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self up to Justice.</p>
            <p>No, my Girl, said I, you are not at all suspected. I don't perceive any Interest that you could possibly have in this melan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>choly Event. No, Sir, said old <hi>Clement,</hi> I can answer for her Innocence; she is but a late Comer; she was particularly tender of me, and, I dare say, knew nothing of the ill Designs of her Mistress. And so, <hi>Hetty,</hi> I will recommend you to a better Mistress, <hi>Hetty,</hi> an Angel of a Mistress, even to my own dearest Daughter, who sits blushing before you there.</p>
            <p>That Night, after the Inquest of the Coroners, Mrs. <hi>Cable</hi> was secretly buried in the Fields, and my Servants interred her Confederate on the high Road; for I did
<pb n="108" facs="107" rend="none"/>not choose to have the sacred Ceremony of our Church profaned over a Reprobate who rejected the Hope of a blessed Resurrection.</p>
            <p>The Day before I set forward, our kind-hearted <hi>Clement</hi> earnestly petitioned to accompany me, and urged his Impatience to embrace You, my <hi>Harry;</hi> but this I peremptorily refused, as I was sensible that his own Affairs demanded his Presence. So I came away, alone, yet attended by the Tears and good Wishes of the happiest Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily that is, I think, within his Majesty's Dominions.</p>
            <p>My dearest Brother, said the Earl, the latter Part of your Story is exceedingly pleasing, and yet scarce makes Amends for the Horrors that preceded. My Flesh, as well as my Spirit, still shudders at the Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter of that accursed <hi>Belial.</hi> I did not think that such a Malevolence and Malig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity of Disposition could be generated in the Bottom of Hell itself.</p>
            <p>And yet, my Lord, I am persuaded, said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> that could it please God, at this Instant, to withdraw from me the Influence of his holy and happy Spirit, I should become altogether as evil as <hi>Belia</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="108" rend="none"/>
I cannot think so, my Brother, replied the Earl, You would still continue a Rati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>onal and free Creature. There is certainly a Distinction in the Nature of Things; there is the Beautiful and Deformed, the Amiable and Detestable; your Judgment would approve the One and reject the Other; and your Freedom of Agency would act conformable to your Election.</p>
            <p>Ah, my Lord, cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> what Things, what Beauty, what Amiableness, what Freedom is this that you speak of? Have you found out another Universe, or another Deity beside Him in whom our Life subsists? Are there any Things in Nature, save the Things of our God? Or what Beauty or Amiableness can they possi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bly exhibit, save what they derive from him; save some Quality or Impregnation, some Manifestation or Impression of his own Beauty or Amiableness?</p>
            <p>To make this Matter clear, let us go somewhat deeper, quite back, if you please, my Lord, to the very Birth of Things.</p>
            <p>Throughout Nature, we find that God can impart to his Creatures a Being, an Identity, a Fire of Life, an Intelligence or Sagacity, a Consciousness, a Force or Acti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on, a Will, and a Freedom, distinct from
<pb n="110" facs="109" rend="none"/>himself, and distinct from each Other; and this is the utmost Extent of Creaturely Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, whether respecting the Powers that are in Hell or in Heaven, whether respect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the highest Seraphim that are in Bliss or in Perdition.</p>
            <p>Now, all these Powers or high Preroga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tives, although distinct from God, are in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finitely far from being independent of him, for he will not, he cannot depart from his Supremacy, nor that Universality of Es<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sence, by and in whom alone all Essences subsist. He can, indeed, impart the fore<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mentioned Powers to any limited Degree that he pleases; but then, in their highest Degree of Fire, Life, or Sagacity, Force, Action, or Freedom, you will perceive, on the slightest Reflection, that there is no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing of the <hi>Beautiful</hi> or <hi>Amiable,</hi> that You spoke of; but that they are equally ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plicable, and may be equally exercised to evil, or good Purposes, according to the Nature or Disposition of the Agent.</p>
            <p>Your Pardon, for one Minute, my noble Brother! I have already specified the many great and wonderful Powers that God can impart to his Creatures, distinctly, though not independently, from Himself. But there is one Power, one Quality which God cannot make Creaturely; which, with all his Omnipotence, he cannot possibly
<pb n="111" facs="110" rend="none"/>impart, in any Kind of Distinction or Sepa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rability from himself; and this Quality is called GOODNESS.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear Lord, in order to convince You of this most capital and most important of all Truths, a Truth upon which, Time, Eternity, and the Universe all turn, as on their Axis; it may be neces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sary to enquire what GOODNESS is.</p>
            <p>It will be answered, that GOODNESS is various and infinite in its Kinds and Degrees. It is so indeed, for it is, at once, ONE and MANY. It springs forth from our God, as the living Fountain in Paradise, that thence divided it into Rivers and numberless Streams, to water and replenish the whole Earth. All those Streams, however, were but so many Parts or Portions of the one variously blessing Fountain, and that Foun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain is LOVE, it is the LOVE of Others, my Lord.</p>
            <p>There is no Species of allowed or con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceivable Virtue, that is not reducible under the Standard of this, their great Leader, and all generating Parent, called LOVE. GOOD WILL is the eternal Blesser of All to whom it is beneficent, and also ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerates its own Blessing in the very Act of its Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="111" rend="none"/>
Here lies the great and impassable Gulph, between God and his Productions, between the Creature and the Creator. The Will of God is an Eternal FIRE OF LOVE to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward his Creatures, and goes forth in Blessings upon them as wide and universal as his own Existence. But the Will of the Creature is confined and limited like its Essence. While it is distinct, or uninform<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed of the Will of God, it cannot possibly act beyond or out of itself; it cannot pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sibly feel for any Thing except itself; it cannot wish any Welfare except its own Welfare, and this it endeavours to com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pass by the Exertion of all its Powers. In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed, we may as well suppose that a crude Rock, at the Extremity of either Pole, while compassed by perpetual Darkness and compacted by perpetual Frost, should yet kindle itself, and beam forth in Light and Warmth upon All around; as that any creaturely Will should, of its own Powers, go forth in Affection or Kindness upon Others.</p>
            <p>From this distinct, selfish, and craving Will of the Creature springs every possible Evil, whether natural or moral. From the Preference of its own Identity to that of Others, ariseth Pride. From the Eager<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of its grasping at all Advantages to itself, ariseth the Envy of any imaginary
<pb n="113" facs="112" rend="none"/>Advantage to Another. Pride, Covetous<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, and Envy beget Hatred, Wrath and Contention, with every Species and Degree of Malevolence and Malignity; and the Disappointment of these Passions produces Rancour and Misery; and, Altogether, they constitute the whole Nature and King<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom of Hell itself in the Soul.</p>
            <p>But, when God is pleased to inform the Will of the Creature with any Measure of his own benign and benevolent Will, he steals it sweetly forth in Affection to Others. He speaks Peace to the Storm of rending Passions; and a new and delightful Dawn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing arises on the Spirit. And thus, on the grand and final Consummation, when every Will shall be subdued to the WILL OF GOOD TO ALL, our <hi>Jesus</hi> will take in Hand the resigned Chordage of our Hearts, he will tune them, as so many Instruments, to the Song of his own Sentiments, and will touch them with the Finger of his own divine Feelings. Then shall the Wisdom, the Might, and the Goodness of our God become the Wisdom, Might, and Good<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of all his intelligent Creatures. The Happiness of Each shall multiply and over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flow, in the Wishes and Participation of the Happiness of All. The Universe shall begin to sound with the Song of Congratu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lation, and all Voices shall break forth in an eternal Hallelujah, of Praise transcending
<pb n="114" facs="113" rend="none"/>Praise, and Glory transcending Glory! to God and the Lamb!</p>
            <p>Hasten, hasten that blessed Period, great God, we beseech thee! exclaimed the Earl. But, tell me, my heavenly Bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, for it is surely in Heaven that you hold your Conversation, and from whence you derive all your Knowledge and Lights; tell me then, is there no Distinction, no Preference, in Matter of Goodness, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween Creature and Creature, between Man and Man? For this seems to be the Consequence of what You have set forth very nearly, I acknowledge, to mathe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>matical Demonstration.</p>
            <p>Your Question, my dear Lord, is very deep, said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and still leads to greater Depths than I would choose to dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>close before our <hi>Harry,</hi> yet awhile. I will however attempt, in few and simple Words, to give you some Satisfaction on this most interesting Article.</p>
            <p>There are two great and capital Errors, under which the World of Man hath la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>boured, and still continues to labour ever since the Creation. The <hi>First</hi> is, that of ascribing and imputing, to Ourselves, every Emotion and Inclination, toward Virtue or Goodness, that we seel within us: The <hi>Se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cond</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="114" rend="none"/>is, that, as free Agents, we are ena<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bled to elect and reject, merely by the Act of an own Will independent of any Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pulse or Bias whatever.</p>
            <p>I have already shewn your Lordship that every creaturely Will, independent of the Will of its God, can be no other than an eager Craving after its own Happiness, and cannot possibly be affected in Behalf of an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other Creature, who is wholly distinct from it and wholly an Alien to it. Where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, every creaturely Will, in such a se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parate and adverse State, is altogether as an <hi>Ishmael,</hi> whose Hand is against every One, and every One's Hand against him.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, I have shewn You that God (the sole Fountain of all Being and Blessedness) can, in his Nature and Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position, be nothing but LOVE; and that, even in loving Himself, he must love his own Productions, the Realizing of his own Ideas, and the Works of his own Power. What, indeed, should hinder our God from being wholly a God of Love? Was there any thing before him, was there any thing coaeval with him to controul or op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose him? Had he any thing to envy, had he any thing to excite his Anger, except his own Conceptions, and These he was at Liberty to bring, or not to bring into Exis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tence
<pb n="116" facs="115" rend="none"/>or Perceptibility, even at his own Pleasure. What then should affect him with the slightest Tincture of Malignity? Could he add to his own Happiness by rousing the hateful Passions within his own blessed Bosom? We may more rationally suppose that the Sun, in his distant Zenith of burning Superiority, should have his Light impaired by the Squirt of a School<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>boy, than that the Deity should be affect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, with any Touch of Malevolence, by any Creature, or by all the Creatures that his Omnipotence can produce.</p>
            <p>Purblind Reason, here, will say; even the Goodness of God himself, in the hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man Heart, will say, if our God is all LOVE, if he is a Will to all Rectitude and Happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness in his Creatures, why did he suffer any Evil to begin in Nature or Creature? Could Evil have arisen contrary to the Will of Omnipotence, if Omnipotence had willed that it should not arise?</p>
            <p>Ah, my Friends, no Evil ever did nor ever can approach the Will of God; neither can he will or affect any Species of Evil in Nature or Creature, but he can allow a tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>porary Evil in the Creature, as a Travail toward its Birth into the more eminent Degree of that Goodness and Happiness which God affects. God cannot affect or take Delight in the Sufferings of the
<pb n="117" facs="116" rend="none"/>most abandoned Reprobate that ever blas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phemed his Name; but, he can will that the Sinner should be reclaimed, to Happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, even by Suffering, when there are no other Means, in Nature, whereby he may be reclaimed.</p>
            <p>Could Creatures, without the Expe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rience of any Lapse or Evil, have been made duely sensible of the Darkness and Dependance of their creaturely Nature, and of the Distance and Distinction be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween themselves and their God; could they have known the Nature and Extent of his Attributes, with the Infinity of his Love; could they have known the dread<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful Consequences of falling off from him, without seeing any Example, or expe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riencing any Consequence of such a Fall; could they have, otherwise, felt and found that every Act of creaturely Will, and every Attempt at creaturely Power, was a Forsaking of that eternal Wisdom and Strength in which they stood; could all in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>telligent Creatures have been continued in that Lowliness, that Resignation, that Gratitude of burning Affection which the slain. Will of the mortified Sinner feels, when called up into the Grace and Enjoy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment of his God; could those endearing Relations have subsisted in Creation, which have since newly arisen, between God and his lapsed Creatures, wholly subsequent
<pb n="118" facs="117" rend="none"/>thereto; those Relations, I say, of Redemp<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, of Regeneration, of a Power of Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>version that extracts Good out of Evil, of a Love that no Apostacy can quench, that no Offences can conquer; if these eternal Benefits could have been introduced, without their Ground or Foundation in the Admission of Evil, no Lapse or Falling off would ever have been.</p>
            <p>To make this Matter still clearer, if possible — In the dark and the bound<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>less Mirror, called Nature, God beheld and contemplated, from all Eternity, the Love<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liness of his own Light and the Beauty of his own Ideas, even those Ideas to which he had determined to impart Perceptibility, or a Consciousness and Feeling of an Owness of Existence, in Him. He also contem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plated, therein, the whole Infinity of Possi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bilities, all Causes with their Consequences in the remotest Relation, all Events that ever should or ever could come to pass.</p>
            <p>He saw that, without an intelligent De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sire, no Creature could be excellent, or formed in his Likeness. But he saw also that, unless such Intelligence should be ruled by his Wisdom, and such a Desire wholly conformable to his Will, the Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture could not be wise, the Creature could not be happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="118" rend="none"/>
In the Possibility of the Creature's Desire of Independence, God saw the Possibility of moral and natural Evil: But he saw that such partial and temporary Evil might be converted to the Production of an Infinity of Good; and he saw that, without the Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mission of such Evil, the Good that bore Relation thereto could not arise.</p>
            <p>He knew that, till the Lapse or Falling off of some of his Creatures, his own in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finite Attributes could not duely be mani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fested, could not be duely adored in the Glory of their Contrast. That no Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, till then, could be duely sensible of its own Fallibility, could be duely sensi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble that Sufficiency and Perfection were solely in God, and that all Things depend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed on him as well for every Quality of Blessedness as of Being.</p>
            <p>He foresaw all the Misery that should attend upon Error; but he saw also how amiable, how beneficial was the Sense of such Error; how it might serve to sap the Self-Confidence of the Creature, and en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gage him to cast his Trust where his Strength alone lay. And he the more willingly permitted the Sufferings of all his fallen Offspring, as the future blissful Period was already present to him, when the Miseries of the short Parenthesis (called
<pb n="120" facs="119" rend="none"/>Time) should be for ever shut up between the two Eternities; and when all his be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>loved and rectified Creatures should enter upon the Fullness of the Enjoyment of their God.</p>
            <p>From the Blackness of Guilt, and the Cloud of Pains, Calamities, Diseases, and Deaths, God saw Remorse, Contrition, Humility, Patience, and Resignation, beam<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing forth into new Wonders of Light and eternal Life. He saw new Relations, new Connections, new Endearments arise, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween <hi>Creatorly</hi> Good and <hi>Creaturely</hi> Evil, between Transgression and Redemption, Repentance and Pardon; and he joyed (without Beginning) in calling his loved Offspring from Error to Rectitude, from Lowliness to Exaltation, from Death into Life, from Time to Eternity, and from transitory Afflictions into ever enduring and ever encreasing Blessedness.</p>
            <p>God foresaw, in future Worlds of new and wonderful Construction, the Frailty and Lapse of his favourite Family of Man. He saw him sunk into the Inclemency of outward Elements, and into the inward Darkness and Wrath of his distinct and li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mited Nature; externally besieged and tempted by lying Offers of Enjoyment, and internally rent by disappointed Desires and malignant Passions. But, he had provided
<pb n="121" facs="120" rend="none"/>a Redemption of such stupendous Potency, as would not suffer the perverse Creature to tear itself out of the Arms of his Affecti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on. He had provided a Seed of the SON OF HIS LOVE, that should take Root in Man's World of inward and outward Evil; that should grow as a fragrant Flower, through Corruption and Abomination, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to the Freedom, the Light and the Purity of Heaven; that should reprove his Un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>righteousness, that should convict him of Wickedness, that should convince him of Weakness, and soften him into Sorrow for his own Transgressions; that should melt him into a Sense of the Calamity of others; that should diffuse as a dawning Light through his dark and angry Nature, sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duing his Pride, assuaging his Passions; calling him forth from Self into the Expan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of Benevolence, into all the Charities and Amities, the Feelings and Offices of the human Heart thus made divine; and lastly, maturing in him a different Nature and a new Creature; that God may be in all Men the ONE WILL TO THE ONE GOODNESS; thereby uniting all Men, as one Man, in their God. For deep, indeed, are all his Counsels; and all the Mazes of his Providence will finally unwind them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves in the Rectitude and Fulness of the Wisdom of his Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="121" rend="none"/>
That a Creature, inexperienced or newly brought into Being, should stand in the State in which he felt his Delight: Or even, that he should fall therefrom, by attempting at something, through an own Will, and the Presumption of an own Power; does not appear to have any Thing very wonderful in it. But that a Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, already fallen into the Misery and Depravity of a second and base Nature, should rise again superior to its original Goodness and Glory; this is the Work, produced in Time, that will be Matter of chief Amazement throughout the second Eternity.</p>
            <p>That Man, I say, fallen into a Body of bes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tial Flesh and Members, fallen into the Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perties of a dark and wrathful Nature; fallen into circling Elements of Hostility, Distem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perature and Dissolution to his Frame; that Man, I repeat it, thus degraded and weak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ened, thus oppressed and assaulted from within and from without, should yet ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vance and proceed through his Course of appointed Warfare, denying his own Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>petites, pulling down his own Pride, com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bating Sufferings with Patience, subdu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Injuries with Love, delighting to labour under the hinder Part of that Cross which <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian</hi> was compelled to bear; conquering, rising, triumphing over
<pb n="123" facs="122" rend="none"/>Desires, Disappointments, Tribulations, Languor, Sickness, failing Existence and Death; and All this, without any Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>straint or Violation of that Principle of Li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berty which his ETERNALLY FREE PRO<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>GENITOR imparted unto him; this indeed is a Wonder to <hi>Cherubim</hi> and <hi>Seraphim,</hi> and, from Eternity to Eternity, the GREATEST WORK of God.</p>
            <p>Here, Brother, said the Earl, you ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pressly acknowledge that Man is a free Agent.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, answered Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> that Man has a Principle or Seed of Liber<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty within him, a Power of turning, or at least of leaving his Will to the Impulse of Good, on the one Hand, or of Evil on the Other, he could not otherwise be account<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able; and this brings me directly to your Lordship's Question respecting the Distinc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, in Matter of Merit, between Man and Man.</p>
            <p>KNOW THYSELF, was the wisest of all the <hi>Saws</hi> in the ancient Schools; for the most useful of all Studies, to Man, is that of Man.</p>
            <p>MAN has been represented, by the Boastings of pagan Philosophy, as equal in
<pb n="124" facs="123" rend="none"/>many Respects, and in some Articles supe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rior to what they conceived of Godhead.</p>
            <p>They define him a rational and lordly Intelligence, sole Dictator to his own Acti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons, Controuler of his own Passions, and of Powers, Virtues, and Faculties, wholly free and independent. But, what says Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture on this Head?</p>
            <p>Man goes out of this World, even as he comes into it, quite passive and without his own Consent. From the Womb to the Time of his maturing in Reason, and even till some Degree of Power is awakened in him toward governing his Appetites and resisting his Inclinations, he is as merely a sensual and servile Machine as any inferior Animal or Brute in the Creation. His Pulses beat, his Blood cruclates, and all the Offices of Respiration, Secretion, and Perspiration are performed, alike awake as asleep, without any more Attention or Care, on his Part, than if he had no Interest or Concern therein.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, he is begirt by out<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward Objects, and outward Elements, that hold an intimate Correspondence and perpe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tual Communication with his Flesh, with all his Organs, and his animal Life; excit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing in him a Variety of Appetites and De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sires that he can no more resist, than a
<pb n="125" facs="124" rend="none"/>Twig can swim against a Torrent; inso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>much that, were this the Whole of the Man, with Respect to his Appetites, he would of Necessity be a Brute, and with Respect to his Passions, he would of Necessity be a Devil.</p>
            <p>Thus far, my Lord, you see that Man is wholly acted upon, and does nothing but as he is incited or impelled thereto; and were there no other Agent within him to act upon him on the opposite Part, had he no present Friend to combat with and controul the evil Propensities of his Nature, he would be as totally a Slave to his carnal and diabolical Lusts, as the Galley-Rower is to the Bench whereon he is chained.</p>
            <p>But, blessed be our all-creating, all-re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deeming, and all-loving Friend, who is ever present in us and to us, and does not leave our Impotence destitute of his Help; who, in the Centre of our old and reprobat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed <hi>Adam,</hi> hath implanted a divine Seed of a new Nature and a new Creature; even the renewed Image of himself in our Souls. It is this infant Resemblance of himself in our Essence, which God always cherishes, which he always elects, which he pursues; which he calls upon by the Word of the Son of his Love, which he informs with the Breath of his holy Spirit, whispering
<pb n="126" facs="125" rend="none"/>into it the still Voice of his own beatifying Affections.</p>
            <p>Now, though these two Seeds or Princi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ples are so intimately united in us, that very few observe any Distinction between them, yet no two Things can be more opposite than they are to Each Other, both in their Natures and Propensities. And, accor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dingly, the great Apostle, <hi>Paul,</hi> hath spe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cified and marked out their separate Offices and Departments with the most exact Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cision. Reach me yonder Bible, <hi>Harry,</hi>— Here it is.—</p>
            <p>
               <q>That which I do, I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the Law, that it is good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me (that is, in my Flesh) dwelleth no good Thing; for to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not. For the Good that I would, I do not; but the Evil which I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a Law, that when I would do Good, Evil is pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent with me. For I delight in the Law of God, <hi>after the inward Man.</hi> But I
<pb n="127" facs="126" rend="none"/>see another Law in my Members, war<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ring against the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in my Members. O, wretched Man that I am, who shall deli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver me from the Body of this Death!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here, my Friends, You see, the Apostle distinguishes, most precisely, between the opposite Natures and Tendencies of the two several Seeds of the <hi>first</hi> and the <hi>second Adam,</hi> between the <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Inward,</hi> the <hi>Vitiated</hi> and <hi>Regenerate,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Man.</hi> The <hi>Old</hi> warring against the <hi>New,</hi> and endeavouring to bring him into Captivity to Sin and Death; insomuch that our own evil <hi>Cain</hi> would willingly slay out<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>right the good <hi>Abel</hi> that is in us.</p>
            <p>Now, between these adverse Offsprings of the earthly and heavenly <hi>Adams,</hi> our <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Principle of Freedom,</hi> or <hi>Power of Election,</hi> is placed.</p>
            <p>On the one Part, we are besieged and assailed by a World of tempting and sedu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cing Objects, that hold intimate Intercourse with our Flesh and carnal Sensibilities, and impel their Influences on our Spirit, through every Organ. While the Rulers in Darkness, enter through the said sensual Avenues, excite their diabolical Passions
<pb n="128" facs="127" rend="none"/>within us, and begin to open a Kingdom of their own in our Soul.</p>
            <p>On the contrary Part, our heavenly Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther is graciously pleased to act upon us, through the kindred Seed of that divine Nature which he had implanted in our Essence. He attracts us strongly though not forcibly; and he sheds into us a Species of mental Feelings and Affections, to which Flesh and Blood is wholly an Alien.</p>
            <p>Here then, when the Will turns away, from divine Influence, and delivers itself up to the Impulses and Operations of the evil Agents, the whole Man becomes a Pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>soner in the Regions of Darkness and Sha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dows of Death, and Nothing but intense Sufferings can awake him to a Sense of the Error, Insufficiency, and Folly of his Pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suits, and of the Loss and Horror of the State in which he lies.</p>
            <p>But, when the Will turns and yields it<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self to the gracious Drawings and Influence of God's blessing Spirit; God opens him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self unto it, and attracts it still more powerfully, till he gradually delivers it from the Slavery of Sense, of Sin, and of Self, into the perfect Freedom of a willing Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice to Goodness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="128" rend="none"/>
Above all, when the Will is assaulted by violent, pressing, and permanent Tempta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions; if yet, with the Assistance of sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>porting Grace, it strives and struggles to maintain the Fight, and to tear itself away from the Custody of Evil, though anguish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing in the Strife, and pierced, even to the dividing of the Bone from the Marrow; then is the Scripture fulfilled that says, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by Force;</hi> then is our <hi>Jesus</hi> in the highest Height of his Throne and Do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minion; then does he deem all his Suffer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings overpaid; and he will, himself, be the Champion in the Will of such a Cham<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pion, and he will fight the good Fight, and run the good Course, and hold fast the good Faith both in him and for him, and he will impute the Whole of his Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quests to the willing Instrument of his Ope<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rations, and will crown him with the Crown of his own Glory, and will stretch out his Existence to the Reception and Expansion of his whole Heaven within him.</p>
            <p>Here then, my honoured Brother, You have your Question fully answered touching the Difference, in Point of Merit, between Man and Man; since no Creature can have any Merit save so far as he opens his Will to the Impressions of the Goodness of God upon his Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="129" rend="none"/>
What, you will say, is this the utmost Merit that the Best of Men can boast, that of barely yielding his Will to the Drawings and Influence of the Spirit of Goodness? —It is, indeed, my Lord, the very Whole of the Merit that any Creature can have, as his own Merit; the very utmost that he can do toward co-operating with his God, and conducing, in any Degree, to his own Salvation and Happiness.</p>
            <p>O, that all Men, that all Men had this Merit, my Friends! that All would open the Gates of their everlasting Souls, and humbly and earnestly petition the King of Glory to come in! This would lead to ever during and ever encreasing Merit; for our God would then impute his own Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rits unto us, not by an outward but inward Imputation, even the feeling Sense and Participation of his Nature, his Powers, and Qualities within us. We should become good in his Goodness, wise in his Wisdom, and strong in his Omnipotence. By resign<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing and surrendring, to him, our dark, empty, hungry, and uncomfortable Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture; we should gain, in lieu thereof, the Plenitude of the rich and illuminating Creator. The Fulness of all Delight would become our Portion and Inheritance; and the Proprietor of the Universe would be our Property and Possession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="130" rend="none"/>
Here Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> paused, and his Audi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors continued in a kind of respectful Musing, as attentive to what he might further offer. At length the Earl exclaim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, Never, never more, my Brother, will I debate or question with You, further than asking your Advice or Opinion, to which I shall instantly and implicilty submit, as I would to that of the highest Seraph in Heaven. Our dear <hi>Meekly,</hi> here, and I had some former Converse on a few of these deep Subjects, and I received much Satis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>faction and Instruction from him; but he was not quite so explicit and convincing as You have been.</p>
            <p>Ah, my Lord, cried <hi>Meekly,</hi> were I as intimate with the Fountain of all Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge, as your precious Brother is, You would not then have posed me in the Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versation we last held on those Heads.</p>
            <p>On the following Day, at Breakfast, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> took out his Pocket-Book, and pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duced Bank and Stock-Bills to the amount of something upward of three thousand Pounds. He then presented them to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and said, Here, Sir, is a little Mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter toward Repayment of the Loan I had from You in <hi>Holland.</hi> I bless, I bless my God, that he has enabled me, thus far, to
<pb n="132" facs="131" rend="none"/>approve myself an honest Man; but, above all, I bless him for giving me once more a Sight of the gracious Countenance of my Patron. But for You, I had miserably perished in a Dungeon; to You, Sir, I owe my Liberty, to You I owe my Life, to You I owe the Recovery of the Inheri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance of my Fathers. With Respect to such Obligations I am indeed a beggar'd Insolvent. But, my Heart is pleased with the Thought, that the Connection between us, of Creditor on your Part and of Debtor on mine, should remain on Record to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Here, the worthy <hi>Meekly</hi> became op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pressed under Sensations of grateful Recol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lection, and, putting his Handkerchief to his Eyes, he sobbed out his Passion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> held the Bills in his Hand, and carelesly casting his Eye over them perceived the Amount. As soon as he saw that his Friend's Emotion had partly subsided, You have, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> says he, You have been quite a Gospel Steward, and have returned me my Own with most unlooked for Usury, and I hear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tily pray God, in Recompense of your In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tegrity, to give You the Principality of ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny Cities in the coming Kingdom of his Son. But what shall I do with this Money,
<pb n="133" facs="132" rend="none"/>my dear <hi>Meekly?</hi> My Wealth already overflows, it is my only Trouble, my only Incumbrance. It claims my Attention, indeed, as it is a Trust for which I know I am strictly accountable. But I heartily wish that Providence would reclaim the Whole to himself, and leave me as One of his Mendicants, who daily wait on the Hand that supplieth All, who seek his Kingdom, with necessary Things. For my <hi>Harry</hi> has enough, and more than enough, now, in the Abundance of his no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble Father. You must therefore keep these Bills to yourself, my worthy Friend; retain, or give, or dispose of them, even as it shall please You; whether as your Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty or as my Property, it matters not Six-pence; but, take them back, you must take them back indeed, my <hi>Meekly.</hi> And so saying, he shoved them over from him, on the Table.</p>
            <p>Ah, my most honoured Sir, exclaimed the repining <hi>Meekly,</hi> sure You would not serve me so! My Soul is but just eased of a Load that lay heavy on it for many, many Years. Be not then so severe as to replace the Burden upon me. It would break my very Heart, should you persist in refusing this little Instance of Acknowledgment from One of your warmest Lovers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="133" rend="none"/>
Here, <hi>Harry</hi> found himself affected and distressed for the Parties, and, in order to relieve them, took the Decision of the Mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter upon himself.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, says he, I will, with your good Pleasure, put a very quick End to this Dispute, and I offer myself to You, as your joint Trustee, to be your Almoner and Disposer of these Bills.</p>
            <p>As I was lately on my Rambles, through some Villages near <hi>London,</hi> the Jingle of a Number of infant Voices struck my Ear, and turning, and looking in at the Ground-Floor of a long Cottage, I perceived about thirty little Girls neatly dressed in a Uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>form, and All very busily and variously employed, in hackling, carding, knitting, or spinning, or in sewing at their Sampler, or in learning their Letters and so forth.</p>
            <p>The adjoining House contained about an equal Number of Boys, most of whom were occupied in learning the Rudiments of the several Handy-Crafts; while the rest were busied in cultivating a back Field, intended as a Garden for these two young Families.</p>
            <p>I was so pleased with what I saw, that I gave the Masters and Mistresses some small
<pb n="135" facs="134" rend="none"/>Matter; and I resolved, within myself, if ever I should be able, to gather together a little Family of my own for the like Purposes.</p>
            <p>Now, Gentlemen, here comes Mr. <hi>Meek<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly</hi>'s Money quite in Season for saving just so much of my own. But hang it, since I am grown suddenly rich, I think I will be generous for once in my Life, and add as much more out of my proper Stock. I shall also make so free as to draw on my Uncle there for the like Sum; and these, totted together, will make a pretty Begin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning of my little Project. As to my poor Father here, he has nothing to spare, for he has already lavished all his Wealth on his naughty Boy.</p>
            <p>My Lord and the Company laughed hear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tily at <hi>Harry</hi>'s little Pleasantry—But hearkee, honest Friend, added the Earl, you must not think to expose me, by leav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing me out of your Scheme; can't you lend me as much, <hi>Harry,</hi> as will answer my Quota? Yes, my Lord, said <hi>Harry,</hi> upon proper Securities, I think I may ven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture. You are a Rogue, and a Darling, and my Treasure, and my Honour, and my Ornament, cried the Earl, turning and bending fondly toward him. While <hi>Harry</hi>'s Eyes began to swim with Pleasure, and,
<pb n="136" facs="135" rend="none"/>casting himself into his Father's Bosom, he there hid the Tears of his swelling De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>light; while Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> sat, silently wrapt in the Enjoyment of the tender Scene.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Harry</hi> was reseated, Gentlemen, says he, I must bid you adieu. I am en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gaged on a Party in the Village this Morn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing. For this Day, I must quit the Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour of being your Lordship's Son, and shall content myself with the Station of One of your Vassals or Dependants; and so saying he rose, and away he shot.</p>
            <p>Immediately the Earl rung the Bell, and Mr. <hi>John</hi> entered. <hi>John,</hi> said he, do you know any thing of <hi>Harry</hi>'s Expedition into our Town to Day? Why, my Lord, said <hi>John,</hi> our loving Townsmen have agreed to do all the Honour they can to the Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rival and Welcome of your honourable Brother. The Day is to be spent in Sports; and To-morrow is to be lighted up with the Bonfires and 'Luminations of this very Night. There is a Football also to be, and I fancy that my Master <hi>Harry</hi> de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>signs to be no better than a Hail Fellow among them.</p>
            <p>Tell me then, my good <hi>John,</hi> could you contrive so as to place us where we might see some of these Diversions without
<pb n="137" facs="136" rend="none"/>being seen? Why, please your Honours, the Football is to be in our Park; and I can raise a Stage of Boards where, by the Help of a Step Ladder, your Honours may get up, and peep over, and so see all that passes. Get it done then, get it done, good <hi>John,</hi> immediately.</p>
            <p>When <hi>John</hi> had gone out to execute his Commission, I believe Sir, said <hi>Meekly</hi> to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> that there is not such a Boy, as your Nephew, no, not in the whole Universe; every Look and Accent, every Motion, Fibre and Member, so won<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derfully answering, to the Meekness and Modesty, the Honour, the Galantry and Intrepedity of his Spirit. He shrinks from Praise, he is ashamed before it; and yet his Words sink, as Balm on the Heart, and his Actions compel People to affront him with rejected Honours whereever he goes. While I look on his lovely and lowly Countenance, and inwardly em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brace him as I would a Part or Portion of my God; I secretly say to myself, you are a Proof, my <hi>Harry,</hi> that the lower the Roots of Humility strike into the Depths beneath, the more the exalted Branches ascend the Heights of Heaven! I attend, I study him, as well for my Instruction as Delight, and look upon and revere him, as the most perfect Copy that ever yet was
<pb n="138" facs="137" rend="none"/>taken of the omnipotent Babe in the Manger.</p>
            <p>The other Day, he preserved his noble Father and me from being rent in Pieces by a mad and foaming Monster of a Mas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiff. But, his Calmness of Courage with his Quickness of Action, his Prowess and Power, on that Occasion, exceeded all that I ever met with in Fable. Pray, my Lord, have you not yet told you Brother of that wonderful Incident? No indeed, said the Earl, my <hi>Harry</hi> continued with us, till within this Minute, and I was cautious of offending him by mentioning the Matter before him. For, he can scarce bear to be thanked for the Charity that he gives, and much less to be praised for any Virtue or Accomplishment. O, my Brother, my Brother, what do I not owe you? a Debt immense indeed, never, never, to be paid, for this precious, this inestimable Treasure of a Boy!</p>
            <p>Ah, my Lord, cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I am already overpaid; your Pearl has over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>paid me for all my polishing. Nay, I am become his Debtor, I am indebted to him for my Life, if that were a Thing of Va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lue. It is now about three Weeks since he delivered me from the greatest Peril I ever was in, and in the wonderful Manner I am going to tell you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="138" rend="none"/>
The Day before he set out for this Place, I desired him to take a Walk with me in the Fields, where I inteded gradually to discover to him the heavy Tidings of the Death of his Mother and Brother.</p>
            <p>Just as I began to open the Matter to him, I heard a sudden and terrifying Roar, and turning my Eye to the Place from whence it came, I perceived a monstrous Bull, tearing the Ground with his Foot, and denouncing his Wrath in the Voice of Thunder, when, quitting a few Kine a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mong whom he stood, he made directly at us. Instantly I cried out to <hi>Harry,</hi> and charged him to fly for his Life, but instead of obeying me, he advanced with a hasty Pace to meet the enraged Animal.</p>
            <p>Never was I in such a Pannic as I then was for our precious Boy. I shook from Head to Foot, and was just going to drop, when the furious Beast stooped his Head to dash our Child to Pieces; but <hi>Harry,</hi> quick as Thought, laid hold on a Horn with one of his Hands, and rising into the Air, threw himself astride upon the Creature's Neck.</p>
            <p>The Bull plunged, and tossed, and tore about at a frantic Rate, endeavouring to
<pb n="140" facs="139" rend="none"/>disencumber himself of his Rider, while <hi>Harry</hi> took out his Penknife and urged him to greater Madness by pricking him with the Point. At length the Monster, all panting, and white with Foam, stood still as a Post. When <hi>Harry,</hi> stooping, made Way through his Hide, opened the jugular Vein, and cut his Windpipe in two, and, after some imperfect Roars, the Creature sunk breathless beneath him.</p>
            <p>Think of my Transports then, my Bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, when I saw my Hero safe and smil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingly triumphant. I said and did Things, I believe, that were quite beside my Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son; but I shall not be so readily alarmed for him, hereafter, as I see that his Action, Intrepidity, and Presence of Mind, make him more than a Match for any living Creature.</p>
            <p>In some Time after, <hi>John</hi> returned and gave his Lord Notice that their Station was prepared, whereupon our Company issued forth and ascended their Seat of Eminence, where, through the Cover of some Trees, they could see and observe without being observed.</p>
            <p>After they had been seated and had talked awhile, of Truth, the LORD, OUR RIGH<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>TEOUSNESS, of Heart felt Peace, and the fearful looking out for Judgment from the
<pb n="141" facs="140" rend="none"/>God of Love, a promiscuous Crowd of many Hundreds of Old and Young, Male, and Female, entered and flooded the Park.</p>
            <p>As All thronged about <hi>Harry</hi> with an affectionate Familiarity; he appointed that Football should begin the Sports; and, two Champions being chosen, Each of them chose his Man, and that Man Ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, alternately, till about forty strenuous and active Youths were ranged on either Side.</p>
            <p>The Field was then divided, and the Ball being tossed aloft in the Midst, they All mingled and jostled together, like Hail<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stones; till, after much running, wrestling and sweating, two Games were successively lost on the Side of the Party where <hi>Harry</hi> had ranged himself.</p>
            <p>Ah, cried the Earl, my poor <hi>Harry,</hi> I find, is not accustomed to rude Sports of this Kind; whereupon Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> laughed and cried, he is a Rogue, he is a Rogue, as you will quickly see, my Lord.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Harry,</hi> Master <hi>Harry,</hi> exclaimed his Associates, had you staid among us, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stead of going to that dull and heavy heeled <hi>London,</hi> we would have taught you to play Football better than you do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="141" rend="none"/>
I never play right, answered <hi>Harry,</hi> but when the Girls are on my Side. And here I lay a Wager of twenty Guineas, in Hands of my Daddy <hi>Dobson,</hi> that, give me but my Choice, Twenty of these pretty Lasses, and I will beat your two Parties of Fourscore from one Barrier to the other. What say you, <hi>Polly Truck,</hi> will you be on my Side? I will side with your Honour against the World, cried <hi>Polly,</hi> and away went her Clothes to her Jacket and under Petticoat.</p>
            <p>On this facetious Proposal of our Hero's, a loud Roar and Laugh was set up, that lasted a long Time. Well, well, Gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men, said <hi>Harry,</hi> I will give you leave to double your Laugh as soon as you are Winners. In the mean Time, my good <hi>Polly,</hi> be pleased to choose me out the rest of our fair Fellows at Football.</p>
            <p>When this was done, <hi>Harry</hi> took them All, both Males and Females, to the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tremity of the Barrier just opposite to his Father, extending to about a Mile in Length; and, while the Girls stood pant<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing through Fear and Emulation behind him, he took the Ball in Hand, and, throwing it into the Air, gave it a Kick, as it descended, aloof from his Adversaries who were ranged directly against him, and
<pb n="143" facs="142" rend="none"/>then following it, like a Bullet, he gave it another Kick before it touched the Ground, and pursued and pursued it, with astonish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Rapidity, till he gave it the last Kick, high over the Trees that reached high over the Wall and over the Heads of his Parents.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, <hi>Polly Truck,</hi> had followed her beloved Patron with all ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ginable Zeal and Speed, and had over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>run all the Lads by near a Furlong. At last she came up to <hi>Harry</hi> panting and quite spent, and wished to wish him much Joy but was not able.</p>
            <p>While these Things were in Agitation, our Company beheld All from behind their Cover, and, as <hi>Harry</hi> approached, their Hearts beat a quick and equal Measure with his Feet, even with such Emotions as <hi>Virgil</hi> ascribes to the Bosom of <hi>Latona,</hi> while she beholds and contemplates her fair Daughter <hi>Dian</hi> so eminently transcend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the Choruses of her Nymphs in Grace, Beauty, and Excellence.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Polly Truck</hi> was come to her Speech, Laws, your Honour! says she, where in the World do you contrive to hide your Wings? I have nine Holland Smocks that I won by running at nine
<pb n="144" facs="143" rend="none"/>Wakes, and never was beaten before, in my Life. <hi>Harry</hi> laughed, and gave his quondam Playfellow a friendly Shake of the Hand.</p>
            <p>The Company now began to come in apace, though yet awhile incapable of Utterance; but, gathering about <hi>Harry,</hi> they silently eyed him from Head to Foot, and beheld him with a Kind of venerating Astonishment. At last, young <hi>Felster</hi> (the Wit of the Town) cries, I have al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways heared, till now, that All were Fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lows at Football, but here is One, I am sure, who has no Fellow. I will bet up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on his Head, or rather on his Heels, a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gainst the ninety-nine Shires, and desire no better than Cripples to side him.</p>
            <p>At length Old and Young, Men and Maidens, got once more together; and the Question was started concerning the next Sports upon which they should enter, when they beheld a mighty Giant ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proaching with Strides that would have suited the Arch of a River. He was called, by way of Eminence, the great <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Rosstown,</hi> and was accompanied by his Kinsman, <hi>Pelt</hi> the Tanner.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Roger</hi> came up, he very af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fectionately saluted those of his Acquain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance,
<pb n="145" facs="144" rend="none"/>asking, what Sport have ye got forward, my brave Boys? The best Sport, answered <hi>Jack Felster,</hi> would be to see your Highness, Mr. <hi>Roger,</hi> get a Fall before Night. That Man, cried <hi>Pelt,</hi> does not step on <hi>English</hi> Ground who will ever be able to crack of that Feat. Why, as to that Matter, said <hi>Roger,</hi> though I rose early this Morning, I have a strong Fancy that I am up for the whole Day. <hi>Tom Truck,</hi> cries <hi>Felster,</hi> if you will get on one Side of him, I will get on 'tother, and try what Hand we can make of this famous Champion.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the Attack began; but <hi>Roger</hi> smiled superior, and handled and played them together as a Show-Man plays his Puppits. Another Wrestler was then added, and then Another, but the Four could no more move him than if he were a Tower; while he lifted them up, in Turns, and laid them successively on the Ground, with the best natured Cau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then came smilingly up and said, Mr. <hi>Roger</hi> if you'll be so kind to teach me the Art of Wrestling, I will make you a Present of twenty Guineas for your Pains, my Daddy <hi>Dobson</hi> there has the Money in his Pocket. <hi>Roger</hi> here surveyed our Hero
<pb n="146" facs="145" rend="none"/>with the most inquisitive Attention. I rejoice to see your Honour, says he, with all my Heart; and indeed, it was for that only Purpose that I came here to Day, having already heard the Story of my Cousin's great Mastiff. But, Sir, as you were proposing, and as I honestly think, you may do wonderfully well for a Wrest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ler of Quality; for you are exceeding finely made as any Thing can possibly be for the Volume of you; and, as the Jockeys say, are the prettiest Fellow of your Inches I ever set my Eyes on. But, you want something of my Bulk, Master, to give you the full Powers. However, I thank your Honour for your generous Proffer, I am ready to enter on my Office whenever you please; and I hope to make the very most of the little Matter that is in you.</p>
            <p>They then grappled, not as Combatants, but as Tutor and Pupil, and the Rogue <hi>Harry</hi> submitted himself, as a pliant Twig in his Hands, while <hi>Roger</hi> continued to initiate him in this Trip and that Trip, and in the various Methods of assailing and evading. When <hi>Harry,</hi> perceiving his Instructor a little overpoised, suddenly gave him an inside Foot, and a Push at the same Instant toward the Part to which he inclined. — Strait, like a Promon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tory sapped with all its Pines, nine Paces
<pb n="147" facs="146" rend="none"/>huge the Giant sidelong veered, the tenth, on bended Knee, his mighty Arm upstaid. — Amazement filled the rustic Pow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers, to see with such Slight moved their Mightiest, and a universal Shout rent the wide Welkin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roger</hi> rose and returned something abash<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed at his Foil; but said, with apparent good Humour, I am sorry that I have not twenty Guineas in my Pocket to pay your Honour, for shewing me that same Trip. However, I hope you will give me one Turn more for the Victory. I now engage you, as a Learner, not as a Teacher. As you will, says <hi>Harry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, <hi>Roger</hi> laid hold on <hi>Harry,</hi> with a truly hostile Gripe, while <hi>Harry</hi> seized his brawny Muscles, as with little Cramps of Steel. Then was seen, on either Side, the long calculated Proportions of Weight against Action, and of Action against Weight. <hi>Roger</hi> several Times assayed to lift our Hero between his Hands, and to lay him, as he had served the other Pea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sants, on the Ground, but could not com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pel him to quit his Gripes. He then sway<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed him hither and thither, and thrust him from him and pulled him to him, and hooked and tripped him on every Side, but felt himself often staggered by the
<pb n="148" facs="147" rend="none"/>quick Efforts of <hi>Harry,</hi> while the Scales of Contest seemed alternately inclining to either Part. At length, <hi>Roger,</hi> beginning to find himself overbreathed, plucked his Adversary to him, and, bending heavily forward, overshadowed and overbore our Hero to the Earth.</p>
            <p>Great <hi>Roger</hi> then rose triumphant, and <hi>Harry</hi> also arose in the best Humour ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ginable. Mr. <hi>Roger,</hi> says he, I hold it truly an Honour that you think me worthy of Contention, although you have conquer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed. But this has been a Kind of Fling for which I don't owe you a Farthing, till you can make me of a Bulk approaching to yourself. But come, Mr. <hi>Roger,</hi> I will not take you at an Advantage, recover your Breath, and then, as you said to me, I hope you will give me another Chance for the Victory.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Combatants again engag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, and mutually exerted their very ut<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most; <hi>Roger</hi> for saving his Honour, and <hi>Harry</hi> for preventing an open Disgrace before the Face of so great an Assembly. They struggled, they put every Power of Strength and Art to the Proof; till <hi>Roger,</hi> finding himself beginning to fail, had re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>course to his former Stratagem, and, plucking <hi>Harry</hi> suddenly to him, would again have overlaid him; but our Hero,
<pb n="149" facs="148" rend="none"/>now aware, slipped nimbly from under him, and setting his right Foot before the right Foot of his Adversary, he gave a Shove, with his left Hand to the Other's right Shoulder, and prostrate fell the great <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Rosstown,</hi> extended over half a Rood of Ground.</p>
            <p>Then, indeed, the Clamours became immoderately high; young <hi>Felster,</hi> above all Others, grew insolently triumphant, and the Girls could scarce be detained on the Ground, while they clapped Hands, and shouted, and sprung up aloft, in the Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gratulation of <hi>Harry</hi>'s unexpected Vic<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tory.</p>
            <p>Our Hero then very affectionately step<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ped forward, and gave <hi>Roger</hi> a Hand to help him up, but he rose very slowly, as he was something hurt by his Fall. Mr. <hi>Roger,</hi> says <hi>Harry,</hi> I am now doubly your Debtor, and will accordingly pay you dou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble Wages, as you have taught me, not only to throw Others, but to throw your<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self also. Adad, cried <hi>Roger,</hi> I find and feel too, that you are already but too well taught to my Hand.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Harry</hi> had paid <hi>Roger</hi> his forty Guineas, Part of which he borrowed from Goodman <hi>Demster, Roger</hi> seized his Hand, and kissing it ardently, he cried,
<pb n="150" facs="149" rend="none"/>O my Conqueror, my Hero, my noble Child! throughout Life may all Enemies fall before you, nor Death itself be able to fling my Boy!</p>
            <p>Just then the great Bell rung loudly for Dinner, and <hi>Harry,</hi> turning and measuring the Height of the Park Wall with a Glance of his Eye, took a short Race, and running up it some Steps, caught hold of the Cope<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, and threw himself over, while all the Assembly poured after him a Shout of A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mazement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> happened to alight within a few Paces of the Stage where his Father and Uncle sat; but not attending to that, he was hastening homeward, when Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> cried out, Ho, ho, honest Friend, whither away so fast? <hi>Harry</hi> stopped and started, and turning about, looked something a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bashed to find that his so highly revered Friends had been the Spectators of his lit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle Feats and Follies; however he advanced toward them in order to help them down, while the Earl whispered to his Brother and said, Now we shall see how proud our <hi>Harry</hi> will be of having overcome the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mous <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Rosstown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While they sat over a temperate Meal, why <hi>Harry,</hi> said the Earl somewhat slily,
<pb n="151" facs="150" rend="none"/>the great <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Rosstown</hi> was but a Babe in your Hands. Ah, my Lord, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> smiling and blushing, you are not yet rightly apprized how that Matter stands. It cost me no less than forty Guineas to prevail upon Mr. <hi>Roger</hi> to let me cast him; but, when your Lordship was a Boy, perhaps you would have thought it but a small Matter for the Pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chase of Honour, especially in the Eyes of the pretty Wenches. Indeed, my <hi>Harry,</hi> said the Earl, I was a very, very naughty Boy at your Years; and, had I been such a Fellow as you are at this Day, I should have kept as large a Seraglio as the <hi>Sophy</hi> himself, and that also of willing and kind hearted Girls.</p>
            <p>Just then <hi>John</hi> entered with Tidings that an Ambassy of a Score of Wenches waited at the Hall-Door, and were pushing before them the prettiest Maiden he ever beheld, to be their Spoke's-woman.</p>
            <p>Immediately my Lord ordered that they should All be introduced, and quickly after a Clatter was hear'd without, crying, In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed, indeed now, Miss <hi>Aggy,</hi> You must and shall speak for us.</p>
            <p>The Door was then thrown open, and a young Creature enter'd, colouring, panting,
<pb n="152" facs="151" rend="none"/>and palpitating, and followed by the Group of Wenches who put her forward before them.</p>
            <p>The Earl, in Pain for her sweet Confusi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on, did his best to encourage her, and or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dered <hi>Harry</hi> to help them round with a Glass of Wine. By the Time that this was done, Miss <hi>Aggy</hi> became a little better as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sured, but had not yet dared to look One of them in the Face, but kept her Eyes bent on the Ground, as though she had been ashamed of their Brightness.</p>
            <p>If—if—my Lord, said she, (tremblingly and whisperingly) if your honoured—your very honourable Brother is here—we come to invite him and his Company to our Town-Ball.—And we will attend you with Pleasure, my little Angel, cried the Earl. But, pray who are you, and where do you live?—So please You, my Father's Name is <hi>Abel Jessamin,</hi> and he is lately come Tenant to Part of your Lord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship's Estate.—Then I will make him a Present of at least a Year's Rent for his fair Daughter's Sake. Here, <hi>John,</hi> give five Guineas apiece to these pretty Lasses to buy each of them a Riband. And, do you hear, bring me twenty Guineas for this their chief Ambassadress.—Not for the World, my Lord, indeed I will not ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cept a Farthing. My Father, though poor,
<pb n="153" facs="152" rend="none"/>is very jealous of his Honour, and should I take any thing from any Man living, he would never suffer me to darken the Light that shines in at his Door.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aggy</hi> then made an elegant Courtesey to the Ground, and retreated, attended by her own Graces, and by the revereing and affectionate Regards of the Company.</p>
            <p>Who can this Creature be, cried out the Earl, so lovely, so uncommon, such a sweet Distinction about her! Ah, exclaimed Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> what a Pity it would be that such Innocence should be seduced, and such Pu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity corrupted! And yet, that is most like<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly to be the Case, said Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> since Beauty is the Bawd that procures its own undoing, and Loveliness the very Magnet that attracts Men to its Destruction. <hi>Har<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry</hi> half suppressed a Sigh, but said nothing.</p>
            <p>The Horses were now immediatly order<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed to be put to, and our Company drove into the Town, accompanied by the Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clamations of Hundreds upon Hundreds who lined the Way.</p>
            <p>As soon as they came to the Market Place, the Coach set them down near a spacious Flooring that was raised, in open Air, about a Foot from the Ground, and
<pb n="154" facs="153" rend="none"/>surrounded with Benches behind Benches, and Benches above Benches, to a great Elevation.</p>
            <p>When they were shewn to the Seats prepared for them, they were served with a Variety of Wines and Cakes; for our open hearted Townsmen had spared no Cost for the Entertainment of their noble Guests and their Neighbours. The Band of Music (the choicest that could be got) then struck up, and the Jubilee was opened in full Triumph.</p>
            <p>My Lord then wished, in secret, that <hi>Harry</hi> and Miss <hi>Jessamin</hi> would lead the Ball; but, observing that his Son looked something dejected, he imputed it to Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tigue, and suppressed his Desire. In the mean Time, the Lads and Lasses entered upon the Stage, and several footed it away featly and with all due Applause.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Harry</hi> had not yet opened his Lips to the too, too amiable <hi>Aggy,</hi> nor even pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented his Hand to lead her out, she de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clined every other Hand that was offered to her. At length, as the Day began to lose of its Lustre. Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> whispered to <hi>Harry,</hi> and requested the Favour that he would dance an <hi>Entry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="154" rend="none"/>
The Desire of Father or Uncle was in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly, to <hi>Harry,</hi> the same as the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mand of the Grand Signior to his Slave. He rose, stood forth, and appointed the Air, and began to move with a slow and graceful Measure. But, as the Notes of the Tune quickened, he quickened his Motions. Ether now appeared to be whol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly his native Element. No Eye could per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive that his Foot condescended to claim Acquaintance with Earth. He trod Air. He spun around. He soared aloft like a Pyramid of Fire; while his Limbs preserv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed the Measure, and his Heels traversed each other, as he shot forward or sideways, with a Quickness that dazzled the Sight. Till poor <hi>Aggy,</hi> in the Exuberance of her Admiration, very innocently and very inad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vertently exclaimed, Sure, sure, that Girl is not born who can deserve to have him. All to herself.</p>
            <p>Happily for <hi>Aggy,</hi> the Company was so intent on the Motions of our Hero, that Few attended to her, save <hi>Harry</hi> himself, who hear'd what she said to the very Bot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tom of his Heart.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Aggy,</hi> utterly confounded, at the Recollection of what she had uttered, thought that the Company and the whole World were privy to her Shame. Her
<pb n="156" facs="155" rend="none"/>Face, Neck, and Bosom were instantly suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fused with Crimson; and she did not pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sume to raise her Eye to any Face, or any Object, till she gently pulled her elderly Aunt by the Sleeve, and, stealing away, deprived the Assembly of its principal Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject and Ornament.</p>
            <p>That Night, after Supper, while <hi>Harry</hi> joined with the Company in a Kind of con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strained Chearfulness, they began to com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pliment him on the Atchievements and Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nours of the Day, when <hi>Harry</hi> replied, in evident Discontent, No more, no more, my Friends! Indeed, I never so thoroughly de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spised and detested myself as I do at this In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant. And so saying, he rose hastily and withdrew to his Chamber.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> soon followed, for he was to lye in the same Room. And he sat down, in Silence, while <hi>Harry</hi> was slowly undress<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing. My dear young Friend, says he at length, I grieve to see you indisposed. In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed, Sir, said <hi>Harry,</hi> I am not quite as I wish, and fear I shall disturb you. Ah, my dear Boy, cried <hi>Meekly,</hi> I know your Disorder perfectly well. I marked the Rise and the Progress, I saw the Whole as plain as <hi>Paul</hi>'s. Had <hi>Aggy Jessamin</hi> been indiffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rent to you, You would have danced and conversed as familiarly with her as with
<pb n="157" facs="156" rend="none"/>any other Wench. But, you dreaded your own Feelings, and you dreaded, still more, that those Feelings should be betrayed to the Observation of Others. I know <hi>Aggy Jessamin</hi> and her Father, She is indeed very lovely and very deserving; but yet She is no Mate for you, my <hi>Harry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah, Sir, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> since you have al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ready seen so far into my Soul, I think I had better open my whole Bosom to you, You will look down upon me, to be sure, you will hold me in the utmost Contempt, but, no Matter for that, so You promise not to love me the less.</p>
            <p>Here, I am deemed a mighty clever Fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low, forsooth, at leaping high Walls, and flinging huge Giants; while alas I am flung, myself, by the least of my own Infirmities, and can no more wrestle against one of my Passions than if Each of them were a <hi>Gre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cian Hercules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I own to you, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> that I love <hi>Aggy Jessamin,</hi> my Heart also tells me that I shall always love her. What then must be the Consequence of my unhappy Affec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion? Neither my Father nor Uncle will ever approve of our Union, and I would rather pine to Death, than offend the One or the Other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="157" rend="none"/>
Should I happen to meet the sweet Girl apart, I fear, nay I feel, that I could not be able to resist the Temptation, and, should she happen to yield, what a Ruin must ensue! If she loved me, it would break the poor Thing's Heart to be forsaken, and the Breaking of her's would break my Heart also. And yet, I could never think of continuing in a criminal Commerce.</p>
            <p>Ah, my dear Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> pity the Weakness of your Friend, and pity the Igno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rance that he is in of his own Spirit. My Heart exulted this very Day in its own Hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mility, while it felt itself insensible to the Acclamations of the Vulgar, and while I reflected that a few Years would soon crip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple the Performer of such trifling Exploits, or possibly render me, in old Age, the ridi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culous Boaster of the Feats of my Child<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hood. But, when the sweet Breath of <hi>Aggy</hi> gave its pleasing Applause to my little Matters, Vanity and Self-esteem sunk, with her Approbation, deep into my Bosom, and I have not yet been able to dispossess them.</p>
            <p>O, such is my Passion for her, that, could I get a Dispensation but for a single Trespass, I would willingly do, for it, whole Years of hermitical Penance in the Wilderness. But, what would that avail, my Friend, or how might a whole Eternity
<pb n="159" facs="158" rend="none"/>atone for the Seduction of Innocence and Corruption of Virtue?</p>
            <p>O, help me then, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> help me to struggle against myself; better is it to suffer All that the cruel Conflict may cost me, than to suffer the Stings of that never ending Remorse which would tear my Soul for having injured the Object of my Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meekly</hi> was in Tears, and could not an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer for some time.—Yes—says he at length, I will assist you in this Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bat, a Combat more glorious than ever was fought by all the <hi>Caesars</hi> and <hi>Alexan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders</hi> that ever drew Sword. And I will pray to the Captain of our Salvation, in your Behalf; that he may sight the good Fight both in you and for you, and finally crown you with the Wreath of eternal Glory! But then you must be ruled, you must conform to the Prescriptions of your severe but wholesome Physician; in short, my dear Child, you must not see her any more.—What, never, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> never see her any more? That is hard, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed:—It is a necessary Hardship; could you answer to yourself the Consequences of such an Indulgence?—I could not, I could not, I confess it, my Friend.—I will prevail upon her Father to send her far from you; and I will look out for some
<pb n="160" facs="159" rend="none"/>agreeable and kind hearted Man who may make her a worthy Husband, and be sensi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble of her Merits.—</p>
            <p>O, you bear too hard upon me, too hard, indeed, cried <hi>Harry.</hi> What, give her to Another? And yet that's an ungenerous Regret; for, why should I grudge that Happiness to Another which I cannot en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>joy? Well then, be it so, since it must be so, Mr. <hi>Meekly.</hi> Take her, bear her, tear her away from my Sight, from my Vi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tals! But then she must not go empty. Take for her two thousand, three thou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sand, five thousand Pounds; she is wel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come, she is welcome to All that I am worth.</p>
            <p>Here, <hi>Harry</hi> sat down and wept, and was accompanied by his Friend. But, the Conflict was now over; and though his Heart was deeply grieved, it was much more at Ease.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, at Breakfast, <hi>Harry</hi> appeared to be quite composed. When the Earl, taking a Bundle of Papers from his Pocket, turned, with a fond and conci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liating Air, to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and said: My dearest Brother, when You shall be at Lei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure to cast your Eye over this Parcel, You will find that I have not been altogether, at least not all along, the unnatural Kinsman
<pb n="161" facs="160" rend="none"/>you had Cause to apprehend. These are Copies of the Letters which I sent in search of You, through several Parts of Europe, and in which I petitioned you to pardon my past Offences, and to return and possess yourself of your Rights in the Half of my Fortune and the Whole of my Heart.</p>
            <p>Precious Pledges, cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> are all Things to me that bring me any Instance of the Affection of so dear a Brother; and so saying he put the Papers into his Bosom.</p>
            <p>But tell me, my ever amiable <hi>Harry Clin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ton,</hi> continued the Earl, where in the World could you hide yourself from my Enquiries these twenty Years past? I have got some scattered Sketches of your History from Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> and my Son here, and have been burning to learn the Whole, but dreaded to ask you that Favour, lest the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>collection of some Passages should give You Distress. I refuse no Pain to do you a Plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure, my Brother.</p>
            <p>Here, the honourable Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> began his Story, as formerly recited, and that Night sent his Auditors weeping to Bed.</p>
            <p>On the following Morning, when he came to that Part of his Narrative where Lady <hi>Maitland</hi> broke away, he proceeded as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="161" rend="none"/>
Having travelled through several Parts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> I took <hi>Germany</hi> in my Tour. I staid some time at <hi>Spa</hi> where I drank the Waters, and within the Year arrived, in perfect Health, at <hi>Rotterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On a Visit to Mr. <hi>De Wit,</hi> at his Villa near the City, he told me, over our Bot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle, that he had, at that Time, in his House and in his Guardianship, one of the most extraordinary Women in the Uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verse. Though she is now, says he, advanc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing toward the Decline of Life, she is by far the most finished Female I ever beheld, while all she says, and all she does, give a Grace to her Person that is quite indiscriba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble. She has a Youth too, her Son, with her, who is nearly as great a Rarity as her<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self; and, were it not that his Complexion is sallow, and that he is something short of a Leg, and Blind of one Eye, he would positively be the most lovely of all the hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man Species.</p>
            <p>You put me in mind, said I laughing, of the <hi>Barratarian</hi> Wench, who was com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mended, to Governor <hi>Sancho,</hi> as the most accomplished Beauty within a League, with this Exception only, that one Eye was blind, and that the Other ran with Brimstone and Vermilion. But pray who are these Won<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="162" rend="none"/>
That, said he, I either cannot or must not declare. They are evidently People of the first Fashion, and must have some uncommon Reasons for their present Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duct, as they live quite retired and admit of no Company.</p>
            <p>I protest, said I, you have raised my Curiosity in Earnest; is there no managing so as to procure me a short <hi>tête a tête</hi> with 'em? I wish there was, says he, for I long to know how far your Sentiments agree with mine in this Matter. Yesterday the Lady told me that she intended to go and reside some Time in <hi>England,</hi> and that I would oblige her by getting a Person, duely qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lified, to initiate her and her Son in the Language of the Country. And now, if such a fine Gentleman could condescend to undress himself, you might come To-mor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>row, as a Person who wanted Hire, and I might introduce you to an Interview by the way of treating, provided you are up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on Honour not to reveal any thing con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerning them or their Place of Abode</p>
            <p>The next Morning I waited on Mr. <hi>De Wit,</hi> under the Appearance of a reduced Gentleman, a Character that excites a Mixture of Contempt and Compassion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="163" rend="none"/>
The Lady received and spoke to me with that dignified Complacence, which awes while it engages, and, while it attracts, forbids an irreverent Familiarity. She was, indeed, every thing that my Friend had boasted of her; for though her Person was all Majesty, her Manner was all Grace. Will you answer for the Discretion of this young Man, Mr. <hi>De Wit?</hi> I will, Madam, says he. I bowed to them both.</p>
            <p>On turning, I perceived that her Son eyed me with much Attention, and I, on my Part, surveyed him with the utmost Astonishment. He laboured indeed, ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parently, under all the Disadvantages that my Friend described; but Enchantment lurked in his Accents and in the dimpling of his Lips; and, when he smiled, Heaven itself was infused through the fine Round<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings of his Olive-coloured Countenance.</p>
            <p>In short, I felt such a sudden Attachment to these extraordinary Personages, that I re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solved to keep on the Deception, at least for a few Days, and accordingly engaged with them at a stated Salary</p>
            <p>I entered on my Province. My young Pupil, especially, began to improve apace. And, as I was particularly cautious of ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serving the distant Respect that suited my
<pb n="165" facs="164" rend="none"/>Station, I grew into great Favour both with Mother and Son.</p>
            <p>How long, Mr. <hi>De Wit,</hi> would say, do you propose to carry on this Farce? Till I can prevail upon them, I answered, to accompany me to <hi>England.</hi> For I feel my Affections so tied to them that I cannot think of parting.</p>
            <p>On a Day as I sat with my Pupil in his Apartment, he happened to let his Book fall, and, as I stooped to take it up, the Picture of my <hi>Matilda,</hi> that was richly enamelled, and set with Brilliants, to a great Value, suddenly loosed from its Rib<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>band, and dropped thro' the Bosom of my Shirt upon the Floor.</p>
            <p>I stood concerned and greatly abashed by this Accident, but my Pupil, still more alarmed, started up and, catching at it, gazed upon it intensely. Ha, my Friend, said he, I doubt you are an Impostor. The Proprietor of this Jewel would never set himself out to hire without some sinis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter Design. Who, Sir, and what are you?</p>
            <p>I own, said I, my sweet Fellow, that I am not what I seem, I am of noble De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lcent, and of Riches sufficient to purchase
<pb n="166" facs="165" rend="none"/>a Principality. — And what then could induce you to impose upon us as you have done? — Curiosity at first, and then the strong Inclination which I took both to you and your Mother at our first Inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>view; neither did I propose to reveal my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self till we should reach my native Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try, where all Sorts of Honours and Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fluence attend you. — Tell me then, said he, whose Picture is this, a very love<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly One indeed; is this the Face, Sir, of your Mistress or your Wife? (looking very inquisitively at me.) Ah, said I, she was once Mistress of thousands of Hearts, No<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bles waited before her Drawing Room, and Dukes near her Toilet. She was once also my Wife: But the dear Saint is now eternally blessed in a more suitable Bride<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>groom.</p>
            <p>Will you indulge me, Sir, said he, with the Story of your Loves? It may atone in great Measure for your late Deception which, however well meant, was very a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larming.</p>
            <p>Here I related to him the short pathetic History that I told you of my <hi>Matilda,</hi> with which he was so affected and in such violent Agitation, that I was quite affright<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed for him and stopped several Times, but he insisted on my proceeding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="166" rend="none"/>
Ah, said he, when I concluded, should I ever be consorted in the Manner that you and your <hi>Matty</hi> were, how blessed I shall think myself! I have, says I, a little Cousin in <hi>England,</hi> perhaps the loveliest Child in the World, and if you will marry her, when you Both come to proper Years, I will settle ten Million of <hi>French</hi> Money upon you. Mean Time I beseech you to say nothing to your Mamma of what has passed. I will not, said he, unless I see a discretionary Necessity for it.</p>
            <p>That Night, I went to the City to settle the Affairs of my Houshold. On my Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn next Morning, I met Mr. <hi>De Wit</hi> at the Gate of his Court. Ah, my Friend, said he, our amiable Guests are departed. Gone, I cried, gone! which Way, where to, I pray you? That also is a Secret, said he, which I am not permited to tell you. Late in the Evening there arrived a Reti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nue of about twenty Servants, strongly armed and mounted, with a flying Chaise and six Horses, and a Packet of Letters. The Lady did not go to Bed, but ordered all Things to be in Readiness for their De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parture against the Rising of the Moon, When they were near setting out, and go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to bid me adieu, Have you no Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mands, Madam, said I, for the good young
<pb n="168" facs="167" rend="none"/>Man your Tutor? Not a Penny, says she, I can't afford Wages equivalent to Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vants of his Quality. How, Madam, said I, is my Friend then detected? But, it was a very innocent and friendly Fraud I assure you; I should not have imposed him upon your Ladyship, did I not know you to be safer in his honourable Hands than in those of any Other.</p>
            <p>I then gave them an Account of your Family, your vast Fortune, nor was I quite silent as to your Merits, my dear <hi>Harry;</hi> and I added, that I was sensible you would be deeply afflicted at the De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parture of Persons to whom you were so strongly attached. There is no Help for it, replied my Lady, we have Reasons of ut<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most Import for not disclosing ourselves to him. Tell him, however, that we esteem him highly — affect him tenderly — shall think of him — shall pray for him — and — and — lastly — that you saw us drop a grateful Tear to his Remembrance.</p>
            <p>As I could extort no further Intelligence from my Friend, Mr. <hi>De Wit,</hi> I parted in a half Kind of Chagrin, and prepared to pursue my Fugitives, though I knew not what Road to take, nor where to turn me for the Purpose. At all Adventures, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever, I set out on the Way to <hi>France,</hi> as
<pb n="169" facs="168" rend="none"/>they appeared to be of that Country, as well by the Elegance of their Manners, as by their Fluency in the Language.</p>
            <p>I was attended by eleven of as brave and faithful Fellows as ever thrust themselves between their Master and Danger.</p>
            <p>On the fifth or sixth Day, as we got on the Borders of <hi>French Flanders,</hi> in an open and desolate Way, with a Forest far on the left, a Man rode toward us on the Spur, and approaching cried out, Help, Gentlemen, for Heaven's Sake, help to rescue my dear Ladies, who are plundered and carried away by the Banditti. They have already killed twenty of my Compa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nions, and I alone am left to cry out for Relief — I bid him lead, and we fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowed!</p>
            <p>In a few Minutes we came where we saw a great Number of the Dead and dy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, covering the Sand and thin Herbage. But our Leader cried out, Stop not here, my noble Friends! Yonder they are, yon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der they are, they have but just taken a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>way all our Horses, Luggage, and Coach, and are now at the Plunder. I am weak thro' Loss of Blood, but will help you the best I may.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="169" rend="none"/>
Here he spurred again toward the Ene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>my, but his Horse would not answer his Courage. I then looked about to observe if any Advantage could be taken; for I perceived that the Ruffians were still very numerous, about Thirty who had survived the late Combat; but, seeing that the Country was quite open, and that we had nothing but Resolution and our God to help us, I commended myself to him in so good a Cause, and, putting my Horse to Speed, I rode full at the Foe, confident of being well and gallantly seconded.</p>
            <p>When the Banditti perceived us, they instantly quitted the Plunder, and gather<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing into a Group, they prepared their Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rabines, and discharged them full at us as we drew near.</p>
            <p>As I happened to be foremost I received the greatest Damage. One of their Balls gave me this Mark in my Neck; Another passed through the Flesh of my left Shoul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der; and Another through my Hat, and left this Scar in my Head.</p>
            <p>But, when we came in upon them, as the <hi>Romans</hi> say, <hi>comminus ense,</hi> Hand to Hand, had they doubled their Numbers, they would have been as nothing to us. My faithful <hi>Irishman</hi> levelled Half a Score
<pb n="171" facs="170" rend="none"/>of them with his own Hand, and in less than three Minutes we had no Opponent in the Field. I then rode up to the Coach and perceived two Ladies in it, pale as Death, and sunk senseless to the Bottom.</p>
            <p>Immediately I ordered <hi>James,</hi> my Sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>geon's Mate, to take a little Blood from them, and, on their Recovery, to follow me, with all my People, and all the Horses, Baggage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the nearest Inn. Then, feeling my Wounds begin to smart, I took my Surgeon with me and gallopped away.</p>
            <p>In about a League, we came to a large House of Entertainment, and, finding my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self sick and qualmish, through the great Effusion of Blood, I had my Wounds di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rectly dressed and, taking a Draught of Wine Whey, got into a warm Bed.</p>
            <p>After a Night of uneasy Slumbers the Curtain of my Bed was gently drawn aside, and awaking, I heard a Voice say, in soft Music, Ah, my dear Mamma, it is he, it is he himself!</p>
            <p>On lifting my feeble Eyes, I perceived a Vision at my Side, of a female Appear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance, but more wonderful and more lovely than any thing I had ever conceived of the
<pb n="172" facs="171" rend="none"/>Inhabitants in Bliss. Her Eyes swam in Glory, and her whole Form seemed a Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>densing or Substantiation of Harmony and Light.</p>
            <p>While I gazed in silent Astonishment, I heard another Voice say, Don't you know us, my Son, my dear Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> don't you remember your Pupils, don't you remember your blind, lame and tawny <hi>Lewis?</hi> he is now turned into that passable Girl there, whose Honour and whose Life you Yesterday preserved at the great Peril of your own.</p>
            <p>Here, seizing her Hand, I pressed it to my Lips and cried, Am I then so blessed, my honoured Madam, as to have done some Service to the two dearest Objects of my Heart's fixed Affections? Soft, says she, none of these Transports, your Sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>geon tells us that Repose is necessary for you. Mean time we will go and prepare the best Regimen that the Place can afford for your Nourishment. And, after that, I will send a Dispatch to my Lord, and let him know how far, how very deeply He, and we, and all his House are indebted to you.</p>
            <p>For that Day, and the following Week, as my Fever grew something high, I saw no more of the Daughter, and the Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
<pb n="173" facs="172" rend="none"/>staid no longer than to administer something to me, or barely to enquire how I was. At length I got a Cool and began to recover, when the former Vision de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scended upon my ravished Senses, the vi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of that <hi>Louisa,</hi> the Sight of whom never failed to bring Cheer to the Eyes and Delight to the Hearts of all Beholders.</p>
            <p>They sat down by my Side, and my Lady, taking my Hand and looking ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derly at me, what would you think, said she smiling, of my <hi>Louy</hi> for a Wife? Ah, Madam, I exclaimed, She would be too much of Bliss, too precious, too glorious, too overpowering for the Heart and Senses of any Mortal. Don't tell me, cries my Lady, in my Eyes, my <hi>Harry,</hi> you are full as amiable for a Husband as she can be for a Wife. Beside, you have earned her, my Son, she is your own dear Purchase, by a Service of infinite Value, and at the Price of your precious Blood. She has told me the Story of your first Love, and the Recollection of it never fails to bring Tears from my Eyes. But I must, here<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>after, hear the Whole from your own Mouth, with all your other Adventures, the smallest Incident will be very interest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to me, I assure you. O, my dear, my sweet Fellow, you are to a Hair the very Man I wish for my <hi>Louisa,</hi> the brave, the tender, gentle and generous Heart; just
<pb n="174" facs="173" rend="none"/>the Thing I would have wished for myself, when I was at the Age of my <hi>Louy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, my dearest, my honoured Madam, loved and honoured next to Heaven, you have not yet told me how your <hi>Louisa</hi> is inclined. Whereupon, the bewitching Creature, archly smiling, and blushing, and reaching forth a polished Hand of liv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Alabaster, Here, she cried, I present you with this Trifle, in Token that I don't hate you—very much.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Clinton,</hi> said my Lady, I have sent off my favourite Servant <hi>Gerard,</hi> with my Dispatches to my Lord. He is the only One that remains of all my Retinue. Your Surgeon has dressed his Wound, and pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nounces it so slight as not to incommode him in his Journey. I chose him more particularly for the Carrier of my Purposes, as he was the Witness of your Valour, as he can testify to my Lord with what Intre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pidity you rushed foremost, into the Thick of the Assassins, and with what unexam<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pled Bravery you defeated, in a short Time, a Body of four or five times your Number. These Things, I trust, will have their due Weight; for, though my Lord is of a lofty and inflexible Nature, he is yet alive to the Feelings of Honour and Justice, so that our Affairs have a hopeful and auspi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious
<pb n="175" facs="174" rend="none"/>Aspect. But, you are a little flushed, my Child; we will not encroach further upon you till To-morrow.</p>
            <p>During the three following Weeks, though confined to my Bed, I was per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitted to sit up, and my Wounds, though not skinned, were healing apace. What Happiness did I enjoy during that ecstatic Interval! the maternal and filial Angels scarce ever left my Side. One Morning, when I just awoke from a terrifying Dream, they both entered with Peace and Comfort and Healing in their Countenances.</p>
            <p>What is the Matter, my <hi>Harry,</hi> said my Lady, your Face does not seem com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed to that Fortitude and Complacence which is seated in your Heart. Ah, Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dam, I cried, I have been all Night tor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mented with the most alarming and horri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble Visions I ever had in my Life. Three times I dreamed, successively, that my <hi>Louisa</hi> and I were walking Hand in Hand, through the Fields of <hi>Elysium,</hi> or on the Banks of <hi>Meander,</hi> or in the Gardens of <hi>Alcinous,</hi> gazing and drinking in large Draughts of Love from Each Other: when at one Time a huge and tremendous Dra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gon, and again a sudden Earthquake, and again an impetuous Hurricane came, and caught, and severed us far asunder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="175" rend="none"/>
But my Visions, my honest Friend, said the heavenly smiling <hi>Louisa,</hi> have been of a very different Nature. I dreamed that, while we were standing on the Brink of a frightful Precipice together, your <hi>Matilda</hi> descended, all celestial, and a thousand Times more lovely than she appears in the lovely Portrait that you carry about you. At first I feared that she came to reclaim you to herself; but, instead of that, she smiled upon me and began to caress me, and taking my right Hand she put it into Yours. Then, ascending in her Bright<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, she hovered awhile on high, and casting down upon me a Look of fixed Love, she gave me a Beck with her Hand, as it were to follow, and was immediately lost in Glory.</p>
            <p>O, my dear Children, cried the Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chioness (for such she was) might I but once see ye united, how I should lift my Head! or rather how satisfied I should be to lay it down in Peace, having nothing further to care for on this Side of Eternity.</p>
            <p>That Night I slept sounder than usual, and did not awake till the Day was some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing advanced. On opening the Curtain, I saw <hi>James</hi> seated in a moody Posture by the Side of my Bed. How are the Ladies, <hi>James?</hi> said I. Gone, Sir. Gone, gone! I
<pb n="177" facs="176" rend="none"/>cried out. Yes, Sir, gone indeed, but with very heavy Hearts, and Both of them drowned in Tears. Here has been a large Body of the <hi>Gens d'Armes</hi> sent for them, so that there was no resisting. Poor <hi>Gerard</hi> went on his Knees to his Lady, to beg Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mission to throw himself at your honoured Feet, as he said, and to bid you adieu, but She would not allow him. Mean time, she charged me with this Watch and Ring, and this Letter for your Honour.</p>
            <p>I catched at the Letter and, tearing it open, read over and over, a thousand Times, what will for ever be engraven in my Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mory and on my Heart.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>WE leave you, we leave you, most Beloved of Men, and we are miserable in so doing, but alas we are not our own Mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tresses. My Lord, for this Time, has proved unjust and ungrateful; and refuses your <hi>Louisa,</hi> as well to my Prayers; as to your infinite Merits. He has affianced her, as it seems, to a Prince of the Blood, and his Ambition has blinded him to all other Considerations. Be not yet in Des<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pair, we shall exert our very utmost to get this injurious Sentence reversed; and if your <hi>Louisa</hi> inherits my Blood or Spirit, not all the Engines in <hi>France</hi> will ever com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pel her to give her Hand to Another.

            <p>Yes, I cried, ye precious Relicks, ye de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licious Memorandums, to my Lips, to my Heart! Be ye the Companions of my Soli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rude, the Consolers of my Affliction! sooner shall this Arm be torn off, and Time itself pass away, than One or the Other shall be divided from my Custody.</p>
            <p>Ah, how useless are Admonitions to the Impatience of a Lover! Fervent Love can know no Fears. I was no sooner able to sit my Horse than I set off directly for <hi>Paris,</hi> with this Precaution only, that my People
<pb n="179" facs="178" rend="none"/>would call me by my Mother's maiden Name of <hi>Goodall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we knew not the Names or Titles of those after whom we were in search, our Eyes became our only Inquisitors, and we daily ranged the Town, poreing into every Carriage of Distinction for a Sight of the Mother or Daughter; and even prying among the Lacqueys and Liveries for the Face of our Friend <hi>Gerard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On a Day, as my valiant <hi>Tirlah</hi> and I rode a broad, reconnoitring the Suburbs, we hear'd a Noise and a Shout of Distress that issued from a distant Farm-House; and, as we hastened up, the Tumult grew louder, and the Cry of Help! and Murder! was se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veral Times repeated.</p>
            <p>We instantly knocked at the Door, but were refused Admittance; when <hi>Tirlah,</hi> alighting, ran against it and, breaking through Bars and all with his Foot, threw the Door off its Hinges.</p>
            <p>On entring, we saw a Man stretched on the Broad of his Back in the Floor, with four Others about him, who were going to use him very barbarously. Stay your Hands, I cried, I will shoot the first Man through the Head who shall dare to proceed in this Business.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="179" rend="none"/>
Why Sir, said a young Fellow, rising, this Man wanted to be gracious with my pretty young Wife, I caught him in the very Attempt, and so I think it but fair and honest to spoil him at such Sport for Time to come. Ay but, said I, you might mur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der him, and I can't suffer that. Come, my Friend, no Harm appears to be done as yet, and if he pays a handsome Penance for the Wickedness of his Intention, I would advise you to pass Matters over for the present. Say, how much do you de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mand? Five hundred Louis d'Ors, said the Fellow; if he pays that, he shall be quit for this Turn.</p>
            <p>Five hundred Louis d'Ors! I exclaimed; why, all the Clothes on his Back are not worth the hundredth Part of the Sum. True, Master, said the Peasant, winking, but his Pockets may happen to be richer than his Clothes. Well, said I, if he se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cures you in Half the Sum, I think you may be satisfied. Why, Master, since you have said it, I will not go back. Where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>upon the astonished Prisoner was permitted to rise.</p>
            <p>What do you say, you sad Man you, are you willing to pay this Fellow the Sum I agreed for, in Compensation of the Injury
<pb n="181" facs="180" rend="none"/>you attempted to do him? I am, Sir, said he, with many Thanks for your Mediati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on. Then, hastily putting his Hand to his Pocket, he took out a Note on the Customs which, with some small Matter of Cash, made up the Money, and we departed the House together.</p>
            <p>As I was just going to mount, he came up and accosted me with Elegance and Dignity. Sir, said he, You have made me your Debtor, beyond Expression, beyond the Power of Princes to pay. Be pleased however to accept the little I have about me, here are five thousand <hi>Louis,</hi> in this little Note-Book. Not a Penny, Sir, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed, I am by no Means in want. You must not refuse, said he, some Token of my Acknowledgment, here is a Stone valu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed at double the Sum I offer'd you. Then, taking from a Pocket the Diamond Button of his Hat, he presented it to me. You must excuse me, Sir, said I, I can accept of no Consideration for doing an Action of Humanity, and I rejoice to have preserved a Person of your Distinction and Generosi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty. I then turned my Horse, and, tho' he called after me, I rode away, being neither desirous of knowing or being known.</p>
            <p>My Researches hitherto being altogether fruitless, I imagined I might, with better
<pb n="182" facs="181" rend="none"/>Likelihood, meet my Beloved, in the pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic Walks, public Theatres, or Rooms of distinguished Resort.</p>
            <p>One Night, as I sat alone in a side Box at the Opera, intently gazing and hungering around for some Similitude of my <hi>Louisa;</hi> there entered One of the loveliest young Fellows I ever beheld. He carelesly threw himself beside me, looked around; with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>drew his Eyes; and then looked at me with such a long and piercing Inquisition as alarm<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed me, and gave me Cause to think I was discovered.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>French</hi> seldom hesitate, he seemed at once backward and desirous of accosting me. At length he entered upon Converse touching the Drama and the Music, and spoke with Judgment and Ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gance superior to the Matter; while I an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer'd him with due Complacence, but in a Manner that partook of that Regard<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lesness for Trifles which then sat at my Heart.</p>
            <p>Between the Acts, he turned and cast his Eye suddenly on me. Sir, says he, do you believe that there is such a Thing as Sympathy? Occasionally, Sir, I think it may have its Effect, though I can't credit all the Wonders that are reported of it. I am sorry for that, said he, as I ardently
<pb n="183" facs="182" rend="none"/>wish that your Feelings were the same as mine at this Instant. I never saw you be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, Sir, I have no Knowledge of you, and yet I declare that, were I to choose an Advocate in Love, a Second in Combat, or a Friend in Extremity, You, You are the very Man upon whom I would pitch.</p>
            <p>I answered not, but seized his Hand and pressed it to my Bosom. I conceive, Sir, continued he, notwithstanding your Fluency in the Language, that you are not a Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive. My Name is <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> I live at such a Place, and, if you will do me the Pleasure of a single Visit, all the Honours, Respects, and Services, that our House can confer, shall be yours without Reserve. Sir, said I, I am of <hi>England,</hi> my Name is <hi>Goodall,</hi> and as soon as a certain Affair allows me to admit of any Acquaintance in <hi>Paris,</hi> You shall be the first Elected of my Arms and my Heart.</p>
            <p>In a few Nights after, as <hi>Tirlah</hi> and I were turning a Corner of the <hi>Rue de St. Jaques,</hi> we saw three Men, with their Backs to the Wall, attacked by nearly three times their Number. We did not hesitate a Moment what Part to take. At the first Pass, I ran one of the Assassins through the Body; <hi>Tirlah</hi> levelled Two more with his oaken Staff, and the rest took to Flight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="183" rend="none"/>
Gentlemen, said One of the Three, I thank you for this brave and seasonable Assistance.—<hi>Roche,</hi> run for a Surgeon, I am wounded, I doubt, dangerously.—<hi>Pierre,</hi> lend me your Arm—Come, Gentlemen, we have but a little Way to my House.</p>
            <p>Though the Night was too dark for ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>amining Features, I thought that the Voice was not quite unknown to me. Within a few Minutes we arrived at a Palace that re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tired, inward, from the Houses that were ranged on either Hand On pulling the Hanger of a Bell, the great Door opened upon a sumptuous Hall, which led to a Parlour, enlightened by a silver Sconce that hung from the Vaulting.</p>
            <p>As we enter'd, the Master turned short upon me, and looking full in my Face, and starting and lifting his Hands in Sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prise, Great Ruler of Events! he cried, the very Man I wished my Brother and Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>panion thro' Life, and this is the very Man You have sent to my Rescue!</p>
            <p>Just then the Surgeon arrived, and I hear'd him hastily asking where the Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quis was. On entering, he said, I'm sorry for your Misfortune, my Lord, but Mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters may be better than we apprehend.
<pb n="185" facs="184" rend="none"/>And immediately he took out his Case of Instruments. One of the Ruffians, said the Marquis, before I was aware, came behind and ran me through the Back.</p>
            <p>The Surgeon then tipt open his Lord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship's Wastecoat, and changed Colour on seeing his Shirt drenched in Blood. But, getting him quickly undressed, and having probed his Wound, he struck his Hands together and cried, Courage, my Friends! it is only a Flesh-business, the Weapon has passed clear of the Ribs and Vitals.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Marquis's Wound was dressed, and that we had got him to Bed, I fancy, Sir, said I to the Surgeon, I may have some small Occasion for a Cast of your Office, I feel a little Smart in my Sword Arm.</p>
            <p>On stripping, he found that a chance Thrust had entered about Half an Inch into the Muscle above my Elbow, and had ripped up some of the Skin. But, he quick<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly applied the proper Dressing, and I was preparing to take my Leave, when the Marquis cried out, You must not think of parting, my dear Friend; You are the Master of the Master here, and Lord of this House and of All that is in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="185" rend="none"/>
The Surgeon then ordered his Lordship to compose himself as soon as possible; and, having wished him a good Night, I sent <hi>Tirlah</hi> to my Lodgings to let my People know that I was well and in friendly Hands. I was then conducted by the Domestics to a superb Apartment, where a Bed was pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pared, and where a small Supper of Ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gancies lay fuming on the Sideboard.</p>
            <p>Having swallowed a few Bits, with a Glass or two of Wine, I rose and sauntered through the Room, musing on my <hi>Louisa,</hi> heavily sighing, and nearly despairing of being ever able to find her.</p>
            <p>Some time after, I sat down, to undress and get to Bed, when a Number of the Officers of Justice silently entered my Cham<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber, seiz'd my Sword that I had put off, and coming whisperingly to me, command<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed me to accompany them, without mak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing any Noise.</p>
            <p>I saw that it was Madness to resist, and, as I went with them, I observed that two of the Family Liveries had joined them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves to the Officers. It then instantly oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>curred that I was in the House of my Rival; that the Marquis was the very Person to whom my <hi>Louisa</hi> had been destined; that I was somehow discovered; and that they
<pb n="187" facs="186" rend="none"/>were conducting me to the <hi>Bastile,</hi> of which I had hear'd as many affrighting Stories as are usually told of the Inquisition.</p>
            <p>Ah, Traitor, said I to myself, is it thus you serve the Man who but now saved your Life at the Expence of his own Blood? Let no One hereafter trust to the bleating of the Lamb or the courting of the Turtle; the roaring of the Lion, and the Pounces of the Vulture, may thus deceitfully lurk under the One and the Other.</p>
            <p>After passing some Streets, they took me to a large House, where dwelt One of their chief Magistrates, being also a Member of their Parliament. Having knocked re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spectfully at the Gate and waited some Time, at length we were admitted, and they took me to a kind of Lobby, where we staid, while One of the Posse went to advise the Justiciary of my Attendance. At length he returned and, accosting me in a Tone of surly and discouraging Autho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity, Friend, says he, my Lord is engaged and not at Leisure to Night; To-morrow, perhaps, he may hear what you have to plead in your own Defence. So saying, he and his Fellows thrust me into a waste Room, and locked and chained the Door upon me, and, laughing, bid me to warm or cool my Heels at Pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="187" rend="none"/>
Fool, Fool that I was, said I, to quit the Side of my brave and faithful Compa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nions, how quickly should we have dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>comfited this Magistrate and all his Host! but I must be a Knight Adventurer for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sooth, and draw my Sword in the Defence of every Scoundrel who goes the Street.</p>
            <p>I then went and felt the Windows, to try if I could force a Passage for making my Escape; but, finding that all were grated with strong and impassable Bars of Iron; O, I cried, that this Marquis, this ungrateful <hi>D'Aubigny</hi> were now in his fuil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est Strength and opposed to me, Point to Point, that I might reclaim from him, in an Instant, the Life I have given!</p>
            <p>I then traversed the Room with an in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>consistent Pace, now rashly resolving on furious Events; and again more sedately deliberating on what I had to do. Till, having ruminated thus for the Remainder of the Night, I at last became more at Ease, and resigned myself to the Dispen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sations of All-disposing Providence, though, I confess, with a gloomy and reluctant Kind of Content.</p>
            <p>When the Day appeared and was something advanced, I hear'd my Door
<pb n="189" facs="188" rend="none"/>unlocking and the Chain taking away, and I concluded that they came to summon me to my Tryal. But, instead of the Offi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cers of Justice, I saw near twenty Men in the Marquis's Livery, who silently bowed down before me, and respectfully shewed me, with their Hand, the Way out of my Prison. I followed them also in Silence, and getting into the Street, I wished to know if I was really free, and turned from them down the Way that led to my Lodgings; whereupon they cast themselves before me, and, in a supplicating Posture, besought me to go with them.</p>
            <p>Finding then that I was still their Priso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner, I gave a longing Look out for my valiant Fellows; but, as they did not ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pear, I suffered myself to be reconducted to the Marquis's Palace, and followed my obsequious Commanders into the proud Apartment, to which they had led me the preceding Night, and where, bowing to the Ground, they all left me and retired.</p>
            <p>As I had been much fatigued in Body and Mind, I threw myself on the Bed, leaving Events to their Issues, and fell into a Kind of starting and intermitting Slum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber, when I heard a Voice, at my Side, shout out, in once loved Accents, O, my dearest Mamma, it is He, indeed, 'tis he, it is he himself!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="189" rend="none"/>
On this I awoke, and rouzed myself, and lifting my languid Eyes, and fixing them on the Object that stood before me; and are you then, I cried, are you also, <hi>Louisa,</hi> in the Confederacy against me?—Say nothing, you are not the <hi>Louisa</hi> I once knew.—I will arise, I will go forth, not all your Gates and Bars and Bolts shall hold me, I will tear my Body and my Soul too, if possible, from you for ever!—Go to your Betrothed, to your Beloved! and leave me to perish, it is a Matter of no Import—I am yet pleased that I saved your Chosen; as it may one Day serve to reproach you with the Merits of the Man whom he has so unworthily treated!</p>
            <p>I could no more. A long Silence on all Sides ensued, save the Language that was uttered by Heavings and Sobbings. When the Marchioness, coming and casting her<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self on her Knees by my Bed; you have Reason, Sir, she exclaimed, you have Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son to reproach and to detest every Branch of our ungrateful Family for ever! you saved myself, you saved my Daughter, and yet the Father and the Husband proved averse to your Deservings, and turned your Benefits into Poison. You have now saved our Son, the only One who can convey our Name to Posterity, and yet,
<pb n="191" facs="190" rend="none"/>from the Beginning, you have received nothing in Return, save Wounds, Pains and Sickness, Losses, Damages and Disap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointments, and, at this very Day, the most ignominious Usage, where you merited end<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>less Thanks and everlasting Renown. Blame my <hi>Louisa</hi> then, and me, but blame not my Son, Sir, for these unworthy Events; he is quite innocent of them, he is shocked and distracted by them; he respects and loves you more than ever <hi>Jonathan</hi> loved the Son of <hi>Jesse.</hi> But he will not, he dare not see you, till we have, in some Measure, made his Peace.</p>
            <p>How, Madam! I cried,—but, no more of that Posture, it pains me past bearing—Is it a Fact, can it be possi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble that the Marquis <hi>D'aubigny</hi> should be your Son? Is he not of the Blood royal, the very Rival whom your Letter rendered so formidable to me? and, was it not by his Order that I was disgracefully confined in a Dungeon all Night?</p>
            <p>No, no, said my Lady, he would have suffered the Rack first. He is in Despair, quite inconsolable on that Account. Let us go, my dearest <hi>Harry,</hi> let us go and carry Comfort to him of whom you are the Beloved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="191" rend="none"/>
Ah no, my Mamma, cried out <hi>Louisa,</hi> let us put no Constraint on Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I pray you! there has been enough of Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finement, we leave him now to his Liber<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty; let him go, even where, and to whom he likes best. Once, indeed, we could have tied this all-conquering Champion with the Spinning of a Silkworm; but now he tells us that neitheir Gates, Bars, not Bolts shall hold him to us.</p>
            <p>Here, I threw myself precipitately at her Feet, Pardon, pardon, my <hi>Louisa,</hi> I cried, O pardon the misdeeming Tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sports of your Lover, and pardon the Faults that Love alone could commit. My Enemies are foreign to me, they and their Injuries affect me not; but you are Regent within, my <hi>Louisa,</hi> you sit throned in my Heart, and the Presumption of an Offence from you makes strange Uproar in my Soul. Well, says she, reaching her Hand and smiling through Tears, since it is so, poor Soul, here is the golden Sceptre for you, I think I must take you to Mercy.</p>
            <p>I caught her Hand, and impressed my very Spirit on the Wax, and my Lady, casting her Arms about us, and kissing us both, in Turns, requested that we should
<pb n="193" facs="192" rend="none"/>go and carry some Consolation to her dear repining <hi>Lewis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we entered his Chamber, the Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chioness cried out, here he comes, my Son, we have brought your Beloved to you, yet not your Mr. <hi>Goodall,</hi> as you thought, but One who is, at once, both your Good Angel and our good Angel, even our own <hi>Harry Clinton,</hi> the Betrothed of our Souls.</p>
            <p>I took my Seat on the Side of the Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quis's Bed, and looking fondly upon him, would have enquired of his Health, but my Speech for the Time was overpowered by my Affections. Then, taking my Hand in his, the Power of this Hand, says he, I have found to be great, but, has your Heart the Power to pardon the In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sults and Outrage you have received in the House of him who is so deeply your Deb<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tor? My Lord, said I, I have already drank largely of <hi>Lethe</hi> on that Head; nothing but my Diffidence of your Regard can of<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fend me.</p>
            <p>You know not, said my Lady, you know not yet, my dear <hi>Harry,</hi> how this provok<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Business came about. I will explain it in a few Words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="193" rend="none"/>
On our Return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and on our Remonstrances to my late Lord of the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>estimable Services you had rendered to his Family, he enquired your Character among the <hi>English;</hi> and, notwithstanding the Report of the Nobility of your Birth and your yet nobler Qualities, hearing also that you had acquired Part of your Fortune in Trade, he conceived an utter Contempt for you, and took an utter Aver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion to you.</p>
            <p>Some Time after, as he took Notice that <hi>Louisa</hi> and I wanted our Watch and our Ring, I dreaded his Displeasure, and gave him Room to think that the Robbers had taken them from us in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and this Report became current among our Domestics.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time my Lord became importunate with our <hi>Louisa,</hi> respecting her Marriage with the Prince of <hi>C</hi>—who was then with the Army, and her Prayers and Tears, hitherto, had been the only Artillery which she had used in her Defence. But, when the Couriers brought Word that the Prince was on his Return, my Lord sent for <hi>Louisa,</hi> and gave her instant and absolute Orders to prepare for her Nuptials. But she, full as positive<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly and peremptorily, replied that her Soul
<pb n="195" facs="194" rend="none"/>was already wedded, that she would never prostitute her Body where her Heart was an Alien, and that all the Tortures of the Inquisition should not change her Resoluti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on. Her Father, thereupon, rose to such ungovernable Fury, that, with one Blow of his Hand he struck her senseless to his Feet. But, when he saw my Lamb, my Darling, all pale and as dead before him, the Tide of Nature returned, and the Conflict of his Passions became so violent, that an Impostume broke in his Stomach, and, falling, he was suffocated, and expired on the Spot.</p>
            <p>Soon after, the Prince arrived. He had never seen my Daughter, but his Ambi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to possess a Beauty of whom the grand Monarch, himself, was said to have been enamoured, had caused him to demand her in Marriage. For that Purpose he also did us the Honour of a Visit. <hi>Louisa</hi> re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fused to appear; and I told his Highness, with the best Grace I could, that she hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pened to be pre-engaged. In a few Days after, he met my Son in the <hi>Thuilleries</hi> and accosted him to the same Intent, but my Son had been previously prejudiced in your Favour, my <hi>Harry,</hi> and answered the Prince with so cold or so haughty an Air, that further Words ensued, they both drew, and his Highness was slightly wounded,
<pb n="196" facs="195" rend="none"/>but, as Company interposed, the Affair was hushed up and, shortly after, the Prince was killed in a nightly Broil upon the <hi>Pont neuf.</hi> We then wrote to our Friend <hi>De Wit</hi> to advertise you of these Matters, and to hasten you hither; but you arrived, my Child, you arrived before there could be any Expectation of an Answer.</p>
            <p>Two Days ago, as I observed that my Lamb's Spirits were something dejected, I prevailed upon her to take an Airing to our Country Villa. On our Return this Morning, we were struck half dead with the News that our <hi>Lewis</hi> was wounded and dangerously ill in his Bed. We flew into his Room, and were still more alarmed to find him in a Fury that is not to be ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gined, while <hi>Jacome,</hi> his old Steward, was on his Knees, all pale and quaking at a Distance before him. Villain, he cried, what have you done with my Friend, what have you done with my Champion, the Preserver of my Life? — Please your Lordship, said he, trembling, I took him for a Highwayman, I saw my Lady's Ring and my young Mistress's Watch in his Custody, I will swear to the Property be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and so I lodged him in Prison — till — till —</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="196" rend="none"/>
Go, Wretch, cried my Son, recall your Information, take all your Fellows with you, and instantly bring me back my Friend, or your Ears shall be the Forfeit, but conduct him to his own Chamber, I cannot yet bear to see him, I cannot bear the Reproach that his Eye must cast upon me.</p>
            <p>All afflicted, and yet more astonished, my <hi>Louisa</hi> and I sat down by the Side of my Son, casting Looks of Surprise and en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quiring Doubt on Each Other. At length I said, what is this that I hear of our Ring, and our Watch? Alas, he is no Highway<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man who took them from us, they were our own free Gift, a Mite in Return for a Million of Services. But do you know any thing of the Possessor? I know, answer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed <hi>Lewis,</hi> that he is the loveliest of Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind, the Preserver of my Life, and that his Name is <hi>Goodall.</hi> Ah! screamed out <hi>Louisa,</hi> there we are lost again; this <hi>Good<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>all</hi> must certainly have murdered our pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious <hi>Clinton,</hi> and possessed himself of our Gifts, he would never have parted with them while he had Life. O my Sister, said my Son, when you see my Friend <hi>Goodall</hi> you will think nothing of your <hi>Harry Clin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ton;</hi> why, why were you so hasty, so pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cipitate in your Choice? a Robber, a Mur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derer? no. Had I a thousand Lives, I would
<pb n="198" facs="197" rend="none"/>pawn them all for the Probity that Hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven has made apparent in the Face of my Preserver.</p>
            <p>It is with Shame and great Reluctance, my dearest Brother, that, at Times, I re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cite Passages tending so much to my own Praise; and yet, did I omit them, I should do great Injustice to the kind and amiable Partiality of Those who were so fondly my Lovers and my Beloved.</p>
            <p>But, Madam, said I to the Marchioness, did you not hint something of his Majesty's being enamoured of my <hi>Louisa?</hi> Ah, such a Rival would be a terrible Business indeed, especially in a Country of unlimited Power.</p>
            <p>There is no Fear of that now, said my Lady. The King has changed his Fancy, from young Mistresses and old Counsellors, to young Counsellors and old Mistresses. But, what I mentioned was once very seri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous and alarming.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Louisa</hi> was scarce turned of fourteen, when the Dutchess <hi>de Choisseul</hi> requested her Company to <hi>Marlay</hi> where the Court then was. The King fixed his Eye on her and enquired who she was, but took no further Notice at that Time. Missing her, however, at the next, and again at
<pb n="199" facs="198" rend="none"/>the following Drawing-Room, he asked the Marquis what became of his fair Daughter, said he had a Place in his Eye for her, and desired, in an Accent of Authority, that he would send her to Court.</p>
            <p>The Marquis instantly took the Alarm. He was ever jealous of his Honour, and singularly nice in Matters of female Repu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tation. He gave his Majesty a Sort of equivocal Consent, and, hurrying Home, ordered me directly to prepare for carrying my Daughter out of the <hi>French</hi> Domini<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons. The Night was employed in hasten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing and packing. We disguised our <hi>Louisa</hi> in the Manner as you saw her metamor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phosed at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and set off for <hi>Holland</hi> before Day. The rest you know, my <hi>Clinton,</hi> as You were the principal Mover in all our Concerns. — But, tell me, my <hi>Lewis,</hi> can you conjecture on what Account those Assassins set upon you? — I de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clare, Madam, said the Marquis, I can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not; perhaps they mistook me for Ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther; or, now I recollect, it might be ow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to some familiar Chat which I had, the other Night, with a pretty Opera Girl, who is said to be in the keeping of a very great Man. But, Madam, you forgot to tell my Brother how my Father was banished, on Account of <hi>Louisa,</hi> to his paternal Seat in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> on the Borders of the <hi>Mediter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ranean.</hi> Very true, said the Marchioness,
<pb n="200" facs="199" rend="none"/>and was not recalled till Madame <hi>Maintenon</hi> was taken into supreme Favour.</p>
            <p>But, I wonder what is become of our faithful <hi>Gerard,</hi> I thought that he would have been the first to come and to throw himself at the Feet of his Hero. Indeed, my <hi>Harry,</hi> he would have tired Any, who loved you less, with his Praises and perpe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tual talking of you and your Exploits. — O, here he comes. — Step in, <hi>Gerard.</hi> Is there any One in this Company that you remember, beside the Family?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gerard</hi> then advanced with a half-frantic Aspect, and kneeling, and grappling at my Hand, seemed desirous of devouring it. God be praised, he cried, God be praised, my noble my glorious Master, that I see you once again, and above all that I have the Blessing of seeing you in a Place, where a Throne of beaten Gold should be raised to your Honour. O, had I been here, all Sorts of Respects and Worships, instead of Indignities, should have been paid to your Deservings But, I have provided for the Hangdog <hi>Jacome,</hi> I have tied him Neck and Heels, and tumbled him into the dark Vault.</p>
            <p>Ay, said I, but, my good Friend <hi>Gerard,</hi> I have not yet got my Share of Satisfaction upon him, pray shew me where he is. I
<pb n="201" facs="200" rend="none"/>then followed <hi>Gerard</hi> to the Place where the deplorable Wretch was cast; and, cut<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting all his Cords, I led him back to the Company, and warmly joined his Petition for Pardon and Restoration.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Jacome</hi> and <hi>Gerard</hi> were with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>drawn. Ah, my Brother, cried the Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quis, what new Name shall we find for a Man of your new Character? Moreover, what shall we do with you, what shall we do for you? You have quite overpower'd us, we sink, we drown under the Sense of our Obligations. We have nothing worth your Acceptance, save this simple Wench, and what is She in Comparison of what we owe you? Ah, I cried, She is That with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out whom all Things are nothing; She is the living Treasure, the <hi>Rachel</hi> of <hi>Rachels;</hi> seventy times seven Years were too short a Service for her! I would not exchange this little pearly Joint of this very little Finger for all the Gems that glow in the Mines of <hi>India,</hi> and so saying, I pressed the precious Finger with my Lips; while <hi>Louisa</hi> turned upon me an Eye of such ineffable Satisfac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion and melting Acknowledgment, as sunk upon my Soul and wrapt it in <hi>Elysium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ay but, my <hi>Harry,</hi> said the Marquis, you ought not to prize your <hi>Louy</hi> as much as me; She did not fall in love with you at
<pb n="202" facs="201" rend="none"/>first Sight as I did. How do you know that, honest Friend, cried <hi>Louisa.</hi> Is there a Necessity that our Tongues as well as our Blushes should be Telltales? Are Maidens to trumpet forth their Thoughts, like You broad fronted Men, <hi>whose Ornament is your Boldfacedness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus happy, above All stiled happy up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on Earth, we joyed and lived in Each Other, continuing a mutual Commerce of delightful Sensibilities and Love for Love.</p>
            <p>Alas, our blissful Junto was soon to be broken in upon. In a few Days, One of the royal Pages came and intimated to the Marchioness that his Majesty required her immediate Presence at Court. And we re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mained in a Kind of fearful and fluctuating Suspense, till her Return.</p>
            <p>As She entered, the Consternation in her Countenance instantly struck an Alarm to all our Hearts. O, my Children, my dear, my dear Children, we must part, she cried, and that too, speedily. Our Hour of Bliss is past, our Sunshine is over, and the Clouds gather thick upon us, heavy laden with Wretchedness. Alas, my Heart mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gave me ever since that inauspicious En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>counter the other Morning. As we came from our Villa a great Funeral met us (a
<pb n="203" facs="202" rend="none"/>bad Omen as I have heard) Our Carriage stopped to let them pass, and the Carriage of the Duke of <hi>Ne—rs</hi> drove up beside us. As we remained within a few Paces of each other, he gazed at <hi>Louisa</hi> with such an unmanner'd Intenseness, as caused her to colour and turn aside. However, he ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>costed us not, nor enquired concerning us; it seems our Arms and Livery were too sure an Indication of our Name and Quality. In short, on my approaching the Presence, the King affected to smile very graciously upon me, and said, I have provided, Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dam, a noble and princely Husband for your Daughter; it is the Duke of <hi>Ne—rs.</hi> Ah, I cried, bending my Knee in a suppli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cating Posture, my Daughter is already engaged by Bands of the most endearing and indissoluble Obligations, to a Man who has preserved the Lives and Honours of all our Family, to a Man who, I trust, by his eminent Courage and Qualities, will become the brightest Jewel in your Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jesty's Crown. Madam, said he severely, you must withdraw your Election, I find I have ordered Matters superior to your Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rits, but my Will is the Law here, and shall be obeyed. I rose, dejectedly curtsied, and withdrew without Reply.</p>
            <p>Ah, I exclaimed, on what Summit does this Rival hold his Abode? I will instantly
<pb n="204" facs="203" rend="none"/>go and scale it, and at once put an End to his Life and his Pretensions! My Lady then, throwing her Arms about my Neck, and pressing her Lips to my Cheek, what Ro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mance, says she, is this, my <hi>Harry?</hi> would you at once fight the Duke, and the King, and the whole Army of <hi>France?</hi> No, my Child, Prudence reduces us to more saluta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry, however deplorable Measures. We must part, my <hi>Harry,</hi> we must part this very Night, and my <hi>Louisa</hi> must depart with you. My Chaplain shall, this Minute, unite you by Ties that Death alone can sunder. Alas, my precious Babes, I little expected that your Nuptials should be cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brated by Tears and Wailings! But, bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter these than no Nuptials. When You are once joined I shall care little for myself. And, if we meet no more here, we may yet meet hereafter, as happily as the Bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>barians who tear us asunder.</p>
            <p>The Chaplain was then summoned and, having performed his Office, no Congratu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lations nor Salutations ensued, save a Kiss and a Sigh of mine on the Hand of my Angel. The Marquis then called me, and drawing me down to him, he pressed me ardently to his Bosom, cried O my <hi>Harry,</hi> O my <hi>Harry!</hi> burst into Tears and dismiss'd me.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="205-298" type="pages">
            <pb n="205" facs="204" rend="none"/>
            <p>Mean while, all was in Bustle and Hurry throughout the Palace. No Festival was prepared, no Bridal Bed laid. Horses, Arms, and Carriages were all the Cry, and the Marchioness, with an anguishing Heart, but amazing Resolution, issued her Orders with a Presence of Mind that seemed serene in the Midst of Tempest.</p>
            <p>I then sent for my brave Fellows, with Orders to double their Arms, and to double their Ammunition. They came according<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly. It was now within three Hours of Day. All was dispatched, all in Readiness, the Carriages were at the Gate. Silence sat on every Tongue and a Tear on every Cheek. I threw myself at my Mother's Feet, I clasped, I clung to them; she wept aloud over me, but neither of us uttered a Word. When, rending myself away, I took my sobbing <hi>Louisa</hi> under my Arm, seated her gently in her Chariot, placed myself to support her, and away we drove.</p>
            <p>When we got clear of the Town, and were speeding on the Way, my <hi>Louisa</hi> started and cried out, O, how fast, how very fast they take me from you, my Mamma! Whither, whither do they carry me, perhaps never to return, never to meet again! I answered not, but kissed her Head and drew her gently to me, and she
<pb n="206" facs="205" rend="none"/>seemed more at Ease. But, after a while, I felt her Agitation at my Bosom, and she exclaimed, From my Birth to this Hour of Wee, my blessed Mamma, never was I from those dear Arms of yours; shall I ever, shall I ever again behold those Eyes that used to look with such Fondness upon me?</p>
            <p>Here, I could no longer contain, but taking her Hands between mine, and weeping upon them, I said, will you then, my Angel, are you resolved upon breaking the Heart of your <hi>Harry?</hi> O no, says she, no, not for Worlds upon Worlds would I break that dear and feeling Heart, the Heart of my Heart, the Heart of which I became enamoured. She then leaned her Head fondly over and, in awhile, fell fast asleep; while my Arms gently encircled and my Soul hovered over her, as the Wings of a Turtle over her new-begotten.</p>
            <p>When She awoke and found herself so endearingly situated; she gave me a Look that overvalued the Ransom of a Monarch; she kissed my Hands, in turns, she kissed the Skirts of my Garments. O, she cried, I will endeavour, I will do my best to be more composed. I know I ought not to repine. I am too rich, too happy. I ought to wish for nothing more, I ought to wish for no One more; since my <hi>Harry</hi> is so near me, since I have him to myself. —
<pb n="207" facs="206" rend="none"/>But — but — And here her lovely Lips began again to work; and the Drops that trembled in her living Brilliants could hardly be restrained from breaking Prison. — Soon after, the Grief of her Heart overweighed her Spirits, and she fell again asleep into my Arms, that opened of them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves to receive her.</p>
            <p>On setting up for the Night, I rejoiced to find that my <hi>Louisa</hi> was something more alive; and that her Repose on the Way had greatly deducted from the Fatigue that I apprehended.</p>
            <p>When we had eaten a Bit of Supper, She looked to me and from me, with down<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cast Lids; and, with changing Looks and a faultring Accent began to say; Will you, will you permit me, my Love, to be Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gent for a little Time, and in a very trifling Matter? Allow me only to be Governess for a few Days, and I promise that you shall be my supreme Lord and sweet Mas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter all the rest of my Life.</p>
            <p>I swear, said I in a Transport, by that precious Head, that you are already Queen-Regent of all my Thoughts and Actions; and that, during my Existence, you shall dispose of all that I have and all that I am, at Pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="207" rend="none"/>
O then, said she, my <hi>Harry,</hi> we must lye apart for some Nights. I would not have our chaste and blessed Bridal stained by Tears and Dirges. Nay, no Hesitation, you have sworn that I am Ruler, and I will be obeyed.</p>
            <p>I then cast myself at her Knees and, hiding my Face in her Lap, Cruel, cruel <hi>Louisa,</hi> I cried, I find You are not yet mine. What shall I do to earn You? But, I will be patient, if possible; I would not, for the World, put the Colour of Constraint on the Love of my Beloved. And so I kissed her Gown, in Token of due Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mage.</p>
            <p>Arising, I called her Maids, and desired that they would order their Mistress's Chamber to be prepared, as also a Bed for themselves in the same Apartment. I then secretly ordered that a Pallet should be spread for myself before her outer Door, and, laying myself down, with my Arms at my Side, I guarded, like the Dragon of old, the precious Fruit of my <hi>Hesperia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length we reached <hi>Calais,</hi> and imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diately sent to the Beach to engage a Ship for wafting us over to the Land of Freedom and Rights, but the Wind was contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="208" rend="none"/>
Mean while the Day advanced toward Evening, and my <hi>Louisa</hi> and I sat toge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther in the Arbour of a little Pleasure-Gar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den that lay behind the House, when <hi>James</hi> came hastening to us and cried, Hide your<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, Madam, for Heaven's Sake hide yourself! here is the Duke de <hi>Ne—rs</hi> with a large Party of the King's light Horse.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>Louisa</hi> started up and attempted to fly, but She trembled and grew faint, and sunk down again on her Seat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James</hi> said I, stay and take care of your Mistress. Then, turning with hasty Steps to the House, I recommended my Spirit in a short Ejaculation, and entered, deter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mined that the Duke should accompany me in Death. His Highness was in the Par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lour. I advanced fiercely toward him. So, Sir, says he, you have cost us a warm Chase — Heavens, what do I see! — and, so crying out, he threw himself back into an Arm Chair, all panting, and his Aspect working with Distraction and Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>appointment. — Cursed Chance! he again exclaimed, are you the Man, <hi>Clinton?</hi> — Ah, I must not hurt You, I ought not to injure You, but, what is then to be done? — Where have you put my <hi>Louisa?</hi> — But, no Matter, let her not
<pb n="210" facs="209" rend="none"/>appear, let me not see her, I could not an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer the Consequence. — I would be just if I could, <hi>Clinton</hi> — O Love, O Honour, how you do distract me! — You refused my Treasures and Jewels, <hi>Clinton,</hi> but then you have rent from me a Gem more esti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mable than my Dukedom — Help Saints, help Angels, help me to wrestle with myself! — Honour, Virtue, Grati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude, O, compel me to be just! — Tear, tear me away, while there's Strength to depart! — Adieu, <hi>Clinton,</hi> you are recompensed; should we happen to meet again, I may assail you without Reproach. And so saying, he rose suddenly and rushed out of the House.</p>
            <p>I then hastened to seek my Love, but had scarce entered the Garden, when I saw <hi>James</hi> on his Knees before her, endeavour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to oppose her Way to the House. But she cried, away, Villain, let me pass, they are murdering my Lord, they are murder<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing my Husband, I will go and perish with him: Then breaking away from him, she shot along like a Lapwing, till, seeing me advancing, she sprung upon my Bosom, crying, O my <hi>Harry,</hi> O my <hi>Harry,</hi> are you safe, are you safe? and fainted away in my Arms.</p>
            <p>The rest of my Story, my Lord, is no way material or entertaining. The Serene
<pb n="211" facs="210" rend="none"/>of heart-felt Happiness has little of Adven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture in it, and is only interesting to the Possessors.</p>
            <p>Having settled my Affairs in <hi>London,</hi> and carrying my <hi>Eden</hi> along with me, I passed into <hi>Holland</hi> to settle and be quit of Mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters there also. For the World that I wished was in my Holding, and all Things else appeared either nugatory or encum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bering.</p>
            <p>It was there that I met our <hi>Meekly,</hi> and taking a pleasant Tour through the Skirts of <hi>Germany,</hi> we entered <hi>France,</hi> and leav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing <hi>Paris</hi> on the right Hand, we reached the Marquis's Country Seat, situate near twenty Leagues beyond the Metropolis.</p>
            <p>What a Meeting, what an Interview! My <hi>Louisa</hi> sunk in Tears, for Half an Hour, on the Bosom of her Mother. And the Marquis would put me from him and pull me to him again, all panting with Tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sport and insatiate of his Caresses! It was too much of Joy, it was Pleasure to pain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing. The Domestics would no longer be estrained from their Share of the Felicity; they rushed in and, as though we had been <gap resp="#uom" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
                  <desc>illegible</desc>
               </gap>ew descended Divinities, they dropped on their Knees, they fell prostrate and clung about us, kissed our Feet, our Hands, our
<pb n="212" facs="211" rend="none"/>Garments, and broke forth into Cries, as though it had been the House of Mourning and Lamentation.</p>
            <p>On retiring, they got my <hi>Louisa</hi>'s <hi>Ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rard</hi> to themselves; he now became a Man of mighty Importance among them. They crowded about him and, in a joint Voice, but a Distraction of Questions, enquired after our Travels, our Adventures, our good and evil Occurrences, and all that concerned us.</p>
            <p>The Marchioness then coming, and cast<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing her honoured Arms around me, and weeping upon me, cried aloud, O <hi>Harry,</hi> my Son, my Son, I delivered my Daugh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter to you, even as <hi>Edna</hi> committed her <hi>Sarab,</hi> of special Trust, to <hi>Tobias,</hi> and I see that you have entreated her very kindly, my Son, my Son!</p>
            <p>As my <hi>Louisa</hi> now began to be apparent<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly pregnant, I earnestly pressed my precious Mother and Brother to accompany us to <hi>England,</hi> the Place where Law was Regent, where there was no Apprehension of In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quisitions or Bastiles; and where the Pea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sant was guarded, as with a Bulwark of Adamant, against every Encroachment of arbitrary Power. They assented with Joy, and the Marquis, going to his Escri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>toir, brought forth Bills to the amount
<pb n="213" facs="212" rend="none"/>of ten Million of Livres, the Produce of some Concerns which he had disposed of for the Purpose. Here, my Brother, says he, if I am not able to be grateful, if I am not able to be generous, I will at least be just; here is the Patrimony to which my lovely Sister is entitled. But, I said to the Marquis, my <hi>Louisa</hi> can admit of no Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cession of Value. Keep your Goods to yourself. Remember how <hi>Esau</hi> said to <hi>Jacob,</hi> I have enough, enough, my Bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, these Things can add nothing to the Abundance of my Blessings. But then, he cried, you must accept them, as a Token of our Loves, and so he constrained and im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pelled them upon me.</p>
            <p>Soon after, we passed to <hi>London,</hi> where we continued some Months, and where my <hi>Louisa</hi> was delivered of my little <hi>Eloisa,</hi> who was said to be the beautiful Likeness of her Father.</p>
            <p>We then retired to my Seat near <hi>Strat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ford,</hi> on the fatal <hi>Avon,</hi> the chief of the landed Possessions that Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> had be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>queathed me; where we remained some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing upward of five Years, happy, I think, above All that ever were happy upon Earth. For my <hi>Louisa</hi> was perpetual Festivity to our Sight and to our Hearts; her Eyes beamed with living and senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mental
<pb n="214" facs="213" rend="none"/>Glory, her Attitudes were Grace, her Movements were Music, and her Smiles were Fascination. Still varying yet exhibiting the same Delight, like the <hi>Northern</hi> Aurora she shone in all Directions. And she sported as though she had gone to Heaven, from Time to Time, and bor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rowed all her Plays from the Kingdom of little Children.</p>
            <p>But, she needed not to go to Heaven, since Heaven was ever in her and round about her, and that she could no more move from it than she could move from herself. She had been, from her earliest Years, the beloved Disciple of the cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brated Madam <hi>Guyon;</hi> and the World, with all its Concerns, its Riches and Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spects, had fallen off from her, as the Cloak fell away from the burning Chariot of <hi>Elijah.</hi> She looked at nothing but her Lord in all Things, she loved nothing but him in any Thing. She was the sweetest Playfellow that ever lived for the Babe of the Manger of <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and he was, in her Heart, a Pleasure passing Sense, as well as a Peace that passed Understanding. Even in conjugal Endearment, her Manner re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fined and chastened the Sense of Possession and her Pudicity awed me in the Midst of Transport.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="214" rend="none"/>
Our Friends now prevailed upon us to accompany them, in our Turn, to <hi>France;</hi> together with our prattling <hi>Eloisa,</hi> who was become the darling and inseparable Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>panion of her Grandmother and her Uncle. We again took <hi>London</hi> in our Way. I there renewed, for a while, my old Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quaintance with my Fellows in Trade, and they persuaded me to join them in a Pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tition to his Majesty for the Restoration of some of the lapsed Rights of their Corpo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration, as your Lordship may remember.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Calais</hi> we turned and, by long but pleasant Journeys, at length arrived at the Marquis's paternal Seat in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> that opened a delightful Prospect on the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> And here we continued upward of five Years more, even as <hi>Adam</hi> continued in Paradise, compassed in by Bliss, from the rest of the World.</p>
            <p>During this happy Period I often pressed my dear Marquis to marry, but he would take me to his Arms and say, O my <hi>Harry,</hi> shew me but the most distant Resemblance of our <hi>Louisa,</hi> and I will marry and be blessed without Delay.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, my Angel made me he joyful Father of a little Son, who was, also, said to be the happier Resemblance
<pb n="214" facs="215" rend="none"/>
               <gap extent="1 page" rend="content:〈1 page duplicate〉">

               </gap>
               <pb n="216" facs="217" rend="none"/>of his happy Father. Then, though I had long disregarded the World and all its Concerns, as I saw a Family encreasing up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on me, and also considered the Poor as my appointed and special Creditors; I resolved once more to return and settle my long suspended Accounts.</p>
            <p>As for the Marchioness, she protested that she could not think of parting with her little <hi>Eloisa,</hi> and that she should not be able to survive her Absence ten Days. So my <hi>Louisa</hi> and I, and my little <hi>Richard,</hi> who was named after you, my Lord, set out by Sea and, after a favourable Voyage, arrived in <hi>England;</hi> comforted however with the Promise that our Friends would join us as soon as possible in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within the ten subsequent Months, we received the joyful Tidings that our Bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther was married to the Third Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Alenson,</hi> that they were all in the highest Triumph, and would speedily be with us in a joint Jubilate on the Banks of the <hi>Avon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after, as my <hi>Louisa</hi> and I rode a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>long the River, pleasing ourselves with the Prospect of a speedy Union with Persons so dear to us, and talking and laughing away at the Cares of the Covetous and the Am<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bition
<pb n="217" facs="218" rend="none"/>of the High-minded; a Fowler inad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vertently fired a Shot behind us; and my Horse, bounding aloft, plunged with me into the Current, from whence however I was taken, and unwillingly reserved to Years of inexpressible Misery, of a Misery that admitted not of a Drop of Consolation.</p>
            <p>Mean while my Love had fallen, with a Shriek, from her Horse and lay senseless on the Sod. Some of my People flew back, and bringing a Carriage conveyed us gently home, where my <hi>Louisa</hi> was un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dressed and put into a Bed, from whence she never rose. Her Fright had given such a Shock to her Blood and Spirits as threw her into a violent Fever.</p>
            <p>On the second Day, while I sat with the Physicians by her Side, <hi>James</hi> put in his Head and beckoned me forth. Ah, my dearest Master, says he, I pray God to give you the Strength and Patience of <hi>Job;</hi> you have great Need of them, for your Calamities, like his, come All in a Heap upon you. Here is a Messenger dispatched from <hi>France</hi> with very heavy Tidings, that my sweet young Lady, your darling <hi>Eloisa,</hi> was cast away, in a Sloop, upon a Party of Pleasure, and that the good old Marchio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness did not outlive her five Days. Then lifting my Eyes to Heaven, Strip, strip me,
<pb n="218" facs="219" rend="none"/>my God, I cried, to the Skin, to the Bone, leave, leave but my <hi>Louisa,</hi> and I will bless thy Dispensations!</p>
            <p>On the next Day, my little <hi>Dickey</hi> was taken ill of a severe Cold that he caught, through want of due Attention during the Sickness of his Mother. As he was of a florid Complexion, his Disorder fell sudden<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly in an Inflammation, on his Lungs, and in less than twenty-four Hours, he went to join his little Brother and Sisters in their Eternity. Did I not feel these Losses? Yes, yes, my Friends; they wrung, they rent my Vitals. Yet I still lifted my Heart in an eager Prayer, and repeatedly cried, Take, take All, even the last Mite, leave, leave me but my <hi>Louisa,</hi> and I will bless thee, O my Creator!</p>
            <p>Alas, what could this avail! Can an Insect arrest the Motion whereby the round Universe continues its Course? On the fifth Day I perceived that the Eyes of my <hi>Louisa,</hi> the Lamps of my Life, began to lose their Lustre. The Breath that was the Balm of all my Cares and Concerns grew difficult and short. The Roses of my Summer died away on her Cheek. All agonizing, I felt and participated her Changes, and she expired, while I dropt and lay senseless beside her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="220" rend="none"/>
I knew not what our People did with her or me afterward. For three Weeks I lay in a Kind of dosing but uneasy Stupor; neither do I recollect, during that Period, when, or whether I received any Kind of Sustenance.</p>
            <p>At length I awoke to the Poignancy and Bitterness of my Situation. I did not awake to Life, but rather to the blackest Gloom of the Regions of Death. And yet it was from this Depth and enfolding of Death alone, that my Soul could find, or would accept an Alleviation of its Anguish.</p>
            <p>O Earth, I cried, where is thy Centre, how deeply am I sunk beneath it! How are the Worms exalted over me! How much higher are the noxious Reptiles that crawl upon Earth! I will not accuse thee, thou great Disposer, I have had my Day, the sweetest that ever was allotted to Man; but O, thy past Blessings serve only to enhance my present Miseries, and to render me the most accursed of all thy Creatures.</p>
            <p>I then rose, and threw myself along the Floor; and my faithful and valiant Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>panions immediately gathered to me. But, finding that I would not be removed, they cast themselves around me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="221" rend="none"/>
All Light was shut out, save the Glim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mering of a Taper, and for seven Nights and seven Days we dwelt in Silence, except the solemn Interruptions of smothered Sobs and Wailings.</p>
            <p>At length my Spirit reproved me. What Property, said I to myself, have these Peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple in my Sufferings, or why should I bur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den those who love me with my Afflicti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons? I then constrained myself and went and took out a Drawer. Here, my Friends, I said, here is something that may help hereafter to dry up your Tears. Divide these Thousands among ye; neither these Counters nor your Services are now of further Use. Fare ye well, fare ye well, my worthy and beloved Brothers! God will give you a more gracious Master, but—but—such another Mistress ye ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver—never will find! I then took Each of them to my Arms, and kissed them, in turns, and the House was in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly filled with heart-tearing Lamenta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions.</p>
            <p>I now expected and wished to be left wholly alone, but <hi>James</hi> and two Do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mestics remained against my Will. I then endeavoured to seem easy, I even strug<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gled to appear chearful, that I might com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>municate the less of Grief to the voluntary
<pb n="221" facs="222" rend="none"/>Sharers in my Misery. O World, World, I said to myself, thou once pleasant World, we have now bid a long an eternal Adieu to Each Other! From thee I am cut asun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der, thou art annihilated to me, and we mu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tually reject every Kind of future Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce.</p>
            <p>Ah, how much deeper was my Death than that of those in the Tomb, <hi>where the Wicked cease from troubling, and where the Weary are at Rest.</hi> While I was dead to every Relish of Light and of Life, I was wholly alive to all the Gloom and Horrors of the Grave. The Rays of the Sun be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>came an Offence to my Soul, the Verdure of the Fields, the whole Bloom of Nature were blasted and blasting to my Sight; and I wished to sink yet deeper, and to own a lower Bottom to myself of Darkness and Distress.</p>
            <p>I no longer regarded what the World thought of me, or what it did to me, and I left my Hairs and my Nails, even as those of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> to grow like Eagle's Feathers and Birds Claws.</p>
            <p>My Friend <hi>James,</hi> in the mean Time, took a Place for me in this Town, in or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der to remove me from Scenes that could only serve to perpetuate or aggravate my
<pb n="222" facs="223" rend="none"/>Misery, by reminding me of the Blessed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness that I had once enjoyed.</p>
            <p>He was now become my Controuler. I was patient and passive to any Thing, to every Thing, and so he conducted me hi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, I neither knew nor cared how.</p>
            <p>In all this Time, though I panted after a State of Insensibility, even as a Traveller, in the burning Desart, thirsts after a cool and slaking Stream. I never attempted to lay a violating Hand on the Work of my Creator. I did not even wish an Alleviation of my Misery, since my God had appointed that I should be so very miserable.</p>
            <p>At length, my Spirit rose from its Black<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness to a Kind of calm Twilight. I called for a Bible and, since this World was in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>capable of a Drop of Consolation, I wished to know if the next had Any in Store.</p>
            <p>As I read, the Whole of the Letter, and of the Facts contained therein, appear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed as so many Seals and Veils that remov<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed from before my Eyes, and discovered Depths under Depths, and Heavens above Heavens to my amazed Apprehension. I had no Vision, no Revelation of these Mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters; but the Conviction was impressed as strongly on my Soul, as though an An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gel
<pb n="223" facs="224" rend="none"/>or God himself had revealed them to me.</p>
            <p>How this came to pass I know not; <hi>Homer</hi> gives to his Heroes a Sight into Fu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turity at the Time that their Spirits are breaking away from the Shackles of Flesh and Blood. And it is not unlikely that the Eye of the Soul when wholly turned from all carnal and earthly Objects, can pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>netrate with the greater Scope and Clarity into Concerns that are merely celestial and divine.</p>
            <p>I have now told ye the Whole of my dreary History, my Friends, till I met with our <hi>Harry,</hi> and the rest our <hi>Harry</hi> can tell.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Harry</hi> was in no Manner of Vein, at present, for entertaining or receiving Entertainment from any One. His Eyes were swelled with weeping, his Spirits to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tally depressed, and getting up, as with the Burden of fourscore Years on his Shoul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders, he retired slowly and silently to his Apartment.</p>
            <p>Here, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> took the Opportuni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty of our Hero's Absence, to apprise the Company of what had passed respecting the fair <hi>Aggy Jessamin.</hi> And why, my dear <hi>Meekly,</hi> said the Earl, why would you
<pb n="224" facs="225" rend="none"/>baulk my Boy? I would rather than fifty thousand broad Pieces get any Offspring of my <hi>Harry</hi> into my Arms, however little it might be, legitimate or illegitimate. He is a glorious Fellow, he cannot be debased by marrying a Kitchen Wench, although his Alliance would ennoble a Princess. What's your Opinion, Brother? Indeed, said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> if the Girl is virtuous, as her Countenance promises, I have no Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jection.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> instantly went, with these indulgent Tidings to <hi>Harry,</hi> but he shook his Head, and said, No no, my Friend, I will not abuse their Goodness. Beside, since I hear'd the Story of my Uncle's <hi>Louisa,</hi> my Passion is not quite so violent. I have formed a perfect Idea of the Bride I would wish; and, if I get not some One answering to the Image in my Heart, I will go unmarried to my Tomb. Yet, as I still ardently love the sweet Girl, I would not for the World risque the Temptation of a Meeting with her; and I am willing to pay roundly for her Removal. Be pleas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed then, my dear Friend, to settle this Matter with her Father, the stipulated Sum shall be ready, on Demand, to any Amount that you please, if they may serve to promote her Happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="226" rend="none"/>
On the next Day, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> introduced to <hi>Harry</hi> a tall and comely young Man in a peasant Dress, but of an Air and Deport<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment much superior to his Appearance. My Lord, said <hi>Meekly</hi> as he entered, you must quit all further Thoughts of the love<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly Miss <hi>Jessamin.</hi> I have here brought a prior Claimant to whom, I am confident, the Probity, the Generosity of your Heart will give Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> rose to receive him, when the Stranger, looking earnestly and amazedly at him, cried out, Ah no, we must All give Place here, I find. Does she know him, has <hi>Aggy</hi> seen him? I will then go and bury myself where my Heart may break in Despair of ever reclaiming her Affections.</p>
            <p>No fear, Sir, said <hi>Harry,</hi> reaching his Hand, give me but to know that you have entitled yourself to her Regards, and my own Heart shall break in a thousand Pieces, rather than oppose or disturb the Peace of two gentle Lovers.</p>
            <p>I will give you our Story, my Lord, in a very few Words. Mr. <hi>Jessamin</hi> and my Father <hi>Jessop</hi> served an Apprenticeship to the same Merchant, and, when that was expired, they joined in Trade to the <hi>Levant.</hi> But, as my Father was of the
<pb n="226" facs="227" rend="none"/>more adventurous Temper, they soon af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter broke Partnership. My Father traded to <hi>Turkey</hi> and the Isles of the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jessamin</hi> confined himself to the <hi>Italian</hi> Coast.</p>
            <p>In one of his Voyages to <hi>Genoa,</hi> he there married and begot the charming <hi>Aggy,</hi> and, returning to <hi>London</hi> after a Number of Years, he fitted out a Ship of considerable Force in order to convoy his Wife and Daughter, with all his Treasures to <hi>En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On their Way home they were taken by a <hi>French</hi> Privateer. Their Ship and rich Cargo were sent to <hi>Toulon.</hi> And Mrs. and Miss <hi>Jessamin,</hi> with some other Prisoners, were taken on board the Enemy's Vessel, that proceeded on her Cruise for further Captures.</p>
            <p>I happened, at the Time, to be on my Return homeward, in a Ship called, WEL<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>COME ENEMIES; she had the Appearance of a Merchant, but was actually better fitted for War than Trade.</p>
            <p>The same Privateer came up with us, and bearing on us, with Confidence, com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manded us to strike; but we answered them with an unexpected Broadside and,
<pb n="227" facs="228" rend="none"/>coming to close Quarters, we nearly cleared their Deck by the Discharge of our small Arms. Soon after, we grappled and board<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed; when, hastening down to the Cabbin, I there for the first Time beheld my <hi>Aggy,</hi> in a fainting Fit, with her lovely Head re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clined on the Lap of her Mother.</p>
            <p>As I kneeled to give Assistance toward her Recovery, she first opened the Morning of her Eyes upon me, then turning them to her Mother, cried, Ah, Madam, what new Misfortune has been added to our Misery? I hope we have not fallen into the Hands of the Infidels. No, Miss, I said, you are free, you are free, and you are freed by Hands that offer themselves of their own Accord to your Shackles.</p>
            <p>When we came to Port, I divided the Freight of our Prize among the brave Fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lows who had seconded me so gallantly. And, having sold the Vessel for three and twenty hundred Pounds, I compelled Mrs. <hi>Jessamin</hi> to accept of it, as some small Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pensation for the Losses that her Family had sustained.</p>
            <p>As soon as I had paid my Duty to my Father, and that the Warmth of his first Caresses was over. Sir, said I, I have melancholy News to tell you. I fear your old Friend and Partner, Mr. <hi>Jessamin,</hi> is
<pb n="228" facs="229" rend="none"/>undone, as to Trade; great Part of his Fortune has been seized by the <hi>French,</hi> and that may prove a heavy Loss to myself also. He has but one Daughter, and might I prevail upon her to accept of my Hand, I should thereby become entitled to all her Father's Possessions. But, Sir, I cried, casting myself passionately at his Feet, if the Happiness of your Son is of any Weight with you, You will still assent to our Union, and thereby make me the most blessed of all human Beings!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Everard,</hi> said my Father, sedately, you know I love you, and I am willing to di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vide that Love between your Fancy and your Fortune. If <hi>Jessamin</hi> lays down twen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty thousand Pounds, in Hand, toward portioning your four Sisters, I will consent to your Union. And that's what I would not do, with any other Wench, under double that Sum.</p>
            <p>As I knew my Father's Disposition to be as obstinate as it was affectionate, I rose and retreated without Reply. I instantly went to Mr. <hi>Jessamin</hi>'s, I found my Char<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer alone. I threw myself at her Knees. I solicited, I urged her to an immediate Marriage. When, blushing like the Morn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, when it arises as ashamed of the Bright<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness that it brings, Sir, said she, we owe
<pb n="229" facs="230" rend="none"/>you all Things, I never can refuse you any Thing that Virtue will allow me to grant. Ah, how cold is that, I cried; I will not accept You as a Debt, my <hi>Aggy,</hi> if your Heart is not a free-will Offering, then let mine burst in sunder, they can have no Commerce together. Indeed, says she, giving her Hand, I never had an Inclina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion for any Other, and I have in the World but the one Objection to you. What is that, what is that?—It is, she cried, with filling Eyes, that I fear to hurt You by a Match so very much dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proportioned to your Merits.</p>
            <p>Her Parents entered and found me still at her Feet. I rose in much Confusion and, taking a Seat, I candidly told them what had passed between my Father and me; and urged the same Petition to them that I had to their Daughter; when Mr. <hi>Jessa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>min,</hi> recollecting himself, gave me an An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer deserving of everlasting Memorial.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Jessop,</hi> says he, had I a Province to bestow along with my Child, you should have it as freely as I would give, of my Water-Cistern, to a thirsty Traveller. But here it happens that the inestimable Obliga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, which you have heaped upon my Family, are quite averse to the Promotion of your present Desires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="231" rend="none"/>
In the first Place, as a Man of Probity, if I wish, one Day, to merit the Happiness of your Alliance, I cannot consent to be a Party in any clandestine Matter. Again, shall a Heart, full, and bursting with Gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>titude, be a Partaker in bringing either Da<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mage or Disgrace, on the only One whom I account my Benefactor and Patron? Last<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, shall a Father, who estimates the Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour of his Child, as a Pearl above the World's Purchase; shall he subject her ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der, perhaps her melting Gratitude, to the Temptation of yielding further than she ought? or even to the Temptation of bind<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing her virtuous Affections beyond the Pow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er of a Retreat? This would be too severe a Tribute even for All that you have done for us. Do not exact it, my Son. My Heart wrings under the Necessity of reject<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing your Suit. You cannot be pained as I am by this Refusal. But it is inevitable. You and my Daughter must meet no more till these Clouds are overpassed and that a new Light, of happier Influence, begins to dawn upon us.</p>
            <p>I answered not. I wept where I sat for Half an Hour, I was not unaccompanied, and I then withdrew.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, I begin to grow tedious in Spite of my Intentions. I returned to
<pb n="231" facs="232" rend="none"/>my Father and requested him, in order, as I said, to get rid of my present Passion, that he would dispatch me abroad upon ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther Voyage.</p>
            <p>I had given him a very lucrative Account of my last, and that made him the less inquisitive respecting the Prize we had taken.</p>
            <p>He assented with Joy, as he feared that my Love might yet contend, and prevail in the Combat against Duty. And he took upon himself the Care of equipping out my Ship in a more gallant Plight than ever.</p>
            <p>The Day before I went on board, I stepped to Mr. <hi>Jessamin</hi>'s. My <hi>Aggy</hi> did not appear, and I found her Parents em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ployed in preparing for a disconsolate Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>treat to the Country. I told them I came to take my Leave, and asked if they would send any Venture by me. The very wor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thy Man then went to his Desk and, taking out the Bills of the Sale of the Privateer, here, my <hi>Everard,</hi> says he, I have nothing to adventure with you save your own free Gift. The Remainder of the Wreck of my Fortune is little enough to supply us with very frugal Accommodations, in our desired Exclusion from the World and its Ways. And here is a little Note of the Place of our Retreat, if ever, my Child, if
<pb n="232" facs="233" rend="none"/>ever—if ever we shall happen to meet on this Side of Eternity! O, I cried, kissing the Bills, if I do not bring you a good Account of these Ventures, never, indeed, shall we meet, till parting shall be no more!</p>
            <p>We then set about taking Leave, and having several Times rushed alternately into the Arms of Each other, we again sat down and wept, till no Tears were left; when, rending myself away from them, and nearly blind to the Way that I went, I departed.</p>
            <p>Within a Year and a Half I returned, and, in a Storm, put in at <hi>Plymouth.</hi> But notwithstanding the Intrepidity, and great Affection of my Companions; though I had made Death and Success as Matters equally indifferent, and on one of which I was determined; yet, our high Hopes and Enterprizings had failed us on several Occasions, and I am come back with little more than ten thousand Pounds for Mr. <hi>Jessamin,</hi> over the Produce of the Voyage which my Father may exact from me.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, with post Horses, and a beating Heart, I have crossed the Country in Disguise, impatient, yet fearful, to know, how the Heart of the nobly inexorable
<pb n="233" facs="234" rend="none"/>
               <hi>Jessamin,</hi> may be affected toward me, and this Morning, as I skulked about the House, this Gentleman met me and, having ques<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tioned me, brought me directly to your Lordship.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Harry</hi> covered his Eyes with his Hand, and musing for a Time, at length said, I fear, my Friends, it may be difficult to bring this Matter about with Propriety. I would not willingly affront Mr. <hi>Jessop</hi> here, by a Gift of the Sum that is deficient to his Happiness. Neither, indeed, would it be duely delicate in Mr. <hi>Jessop</hi> to offer, to his Father-in-law, a Penny beyond what his Venture, so well supported by Mr. <hi>Jessop</hi>'s Bravery, had acquired. You therefore, my dear Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> shall be the Conduit of the Expedient that I propose on the Occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion. I question if the War was proclaim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed when <hi>Jessamin</hi>'s Ship was made Prize; but, be that Matter as it may, I trust I have Interest sufficient to procure a Resto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration the first Treaty of Peace. Do you therefore, my Friend, get me an Order from <hi>Jessamin</hi> for £.10000, on the first of his Effects in <hi>France,</hi> (with legal Interest however) and then take this Key and deli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver to our Friends the very utmost of the Sum required by the Father of the darling Fellow who is now before me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="235" rend="none"/>
               <hi>Meekly</hi> then sprung up, advanced in Years as he was, and catching and clinging about <hi>Harry,</hi> O my Hero, my <hi>Scipio,</hi> he cried, you are the Champion whom Hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven delighteth to empower to subdue itself by Violence! Go on, till the Wreath of Triumph shall be bound to your Head in all its prepared Glories!</p>
            <p>Mean while, young <hi>Jessop,</hi> lay prostrate, in the Oppression and Agony of Gratitude, at the Feet of his younger Patron. But <hi>Harry</hi> gently and affectionatly disengaging himself from them, withdrew to his Closet, saying to his own Heart; now <hi>Aggy</hi> adieu, adieu <hi>Aggy,</hi> for ever!</p>
            <p>For three succeeding <hi>Sundays,</hi> our Hero hear'd the Bands of Marriage published be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween <hi>Everard Jessop</hi> and <hi>Agnes Jessamin,</hi> all which he bore with the Firmness of a Stoic, or rather with the Resignation of a Christian who keeps a Look forward to a more pearly Hope.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, some may be curious to know how <hi>Aggy</hi> stood affected in regard to our young Lord. Let it suffice to be told that she made the worthiest of Wives to the very worthy <hi>Everard,</hi> notwithstanding that he had the Imprudence to tell her of <hi>Harry</hi>'s Regard for her, as also of the Obligations by
<pb n="235" facs="236" rend="none"/>which he had bound them. <hi>Aggy,</hi> there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, could not justly refuse <hi>Harry</hi> a Share in her Friendship, and there is something extremely tender in the Friendship of a ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerous Female.</p>
            <p>Be that as it may, in about three Weeks after her Marriage, as she walked, with two fair Visitants, in a pleasant Field behind the Town, she saw our Hero coming to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward her, attended by two Servants, and galantly mounted on a proud young Steed, whom he had undertaken to dress, and was now gracefully riding to the Manage.</p>
            <p>She felt a sudden Alarm she knew not why, and, as <hi>Harry</hi> approached, she turn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed away that he might not recognize her. But, as soon as he had passed, she gave one Look after him, and feeling herself discomposed by a little hysterical Fit, she sat down on the Grass between her Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>panions, and wept till she was restored to her Strength and Spirits.</p>
            <p>In a few Days after, she set out for <hi>Lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don,</hi> where she became the daily Idol of her Father-in-law, and saw our <hi>Harry</hi> no more.</p>
            <p>On an Evening, after Coffee, as the Earl stood fondly fooling with his <hi>Harry,</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="237" rend="none"/>as one Child with Another, he turned to Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and said, How came it to pass, my Brother, that <hi>Jesus</hi> suffered near four thousand Years to elapse, before he became incarnate for the Salvation of the World, although it was by him alone that the World could be saved?</p>
            <p>We may as well demand of God, said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> why he suffered near four Days of Creation to lapse, before he com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pacted yon glorious Body of far beaming Light. For, this Matter was barely a Type, and the Sun himself but a Shadow of the CHRIST that was to come. But, did the World want Light, before Light became incorporated in its illustrious Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumscription? No, my Lord. JESUS, who was from Eternity the Illumination of the dark Immensity of Nature; <hi>Jesus</hi> who, a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lone, is the living Light of Spirit, Soul, and Sentiment; the perpetual Fountain of the Streams of Beauty and Truth; he said, LET THERE BE LIGHT! and instantly, through the Darkness of a ruined World, the <hi>Internity</hi> of his ever living Light kindled up an <hi>Externity</hi> of corporeal Irradiation, that has its Effluence from him, and cannot beam but by him.</p>
            <p>Now, as a Day is as a thousand Years, and a thousand Years as a Day, in the Sight of God; you see that the fourth Day of Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
<pb n="237" facs="238" rend="none"/>wherein the Light of this outward World was compacted into the glorious Body of the Sun, precisely answers to the four thousandth Year, wherein <hi>Jesus,</hi> the Light of Eternity was to become embodied and incarnate in Christ the SUN OF RIGH<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>TEOUSNESS.</p>
            <p>But, as the World wanted not Light, before the Sun opened his first Morning in the East, neither did it want the Means of Salvation before the blessed Doctrine of MESSIAH was promulged upon Earth!</p>
            <p>All Sorts of Sectarians, All Persons of selfish and little Minds would make a Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nopoly of the SAVIOUR, they would shut him up into a Conventicle, and say to their God, <hi>thus far shalt thou go, and no further.</hi> But he is not so to be confined. The Spi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rit of our <hi>Jesus</hi> bloweth wide and where he listeth. And he is at once both the Puri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fier and Redeemer, as well of all Nations, as also of all Nature.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, we see that the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are wholly unblessed by true Religion or Liberty; who live the Slaves of Slaves; without a Form of civil Government; tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>porally subjected to the Will of a Tyrant; and spiritually to the Worship of a sensual Impostor; yet want not the Feelings of our JESUS in their Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="239" rend="none"/>
Even the wild <hi>Indians,</hi> who never listen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed to the Toll of a Bell, nor ever were called into any Court of civil Judicature; These want not their Attachments, their Friendships, their Family-feelings, nor the sweet Compunctions and Emotions of the human Heart, by <hi>Jesus,</hi> forming to DI<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>VINE.</p>
            <p>The Truth is that People live, incom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parably more, by Impulse and Inclination than by Reason and Precept. Reason and Precept are not always within our Beck; to have their due Influence, they require frequent Inculcation and frequent Recollec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion; but Impulse and Inclination are more than at Hand, they are within us, and, from the Citadel, rule the Outworks of Man at Pleasure.</p>
            <p>When the Apostle, speaking of CHRIST, affirms that <hi>there is no other</hi> NAME <hi>under Heaven whereby a Man may be saved.</hi> And again, when he affirms that Those, <hi>who have not received the Law, are a Law unto themselves.</hi> He intends one and the same Thing. He intends that CHRIST, from the Fall of Man, is a PRINCIPLE OF RE<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>DEMPTION in the Bosoms of All Living. That he is not an <hi>outward</hi> but an <hi>inward Redeemer,</hi> working out our Salvation <hi>by
<pb n="239" facs="240" rend="none"/>the Change of our depraved Nature.</hi> That in and from Him, alone, arise all the Senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments and Sensibilities, that warm the Heart with Love, that expand it with Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour, that wring it with Compunction, or that heave it with the Story of distant Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tress. And that He alone can be qualified to be Judge at the last Day, Who, from the first Day to the last, was internally a Co-Operator and Witness of all that ever passed within the Bosoms of all Men.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that, although the Christian Countries have received the <hi>two Tables</hi> of the Laws of Christ, his <hi>external</hi> as well as <hi>internal Revelation,</hi> (Each witnessing to the Other that the God of our <hi>Gospel</hi> is the God of our <hi>Nature</hi>) the Nations however, who are Strangers to his Name, yet ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>knowledge his Influence, they do not in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed <hi>hear,</hi> but they <hi>feel</hi> the Precepts of that LIGHT <hi>which lighteth every Man who com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>eth into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My dearest Brother, said the Earl, my Conceptions are quite clear with respect to the Omnipresence of Christ's Divinity. But, as his Body is circumscribed by external Features and Lineaments, I can form no Notion of its being in several Places at once. How then will it be, I pray you, at and after the last Day? Will he be present to, and approachable only by a select Number
<pb n="240" facs="241" rend="none"/>of his Saints; or will he go certain Journeys and Circuits through the Heavens, blessing All, in Rotation, with his beatific Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sence?</p>
            <p>Is not the Body of yonder Sun circum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scribed, my Lord? Most certainly — It is now, said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> at a Distance of many Millions of Leagues from You, and yet You see it as evidently and feel its In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fluence as powerfully as if it were within your Reach. Nay, it is more than within your Reach, it is within your Existence. It supplies Comfort and Life to your animal Body and Life; and you could not survive an Hour without its Influence and Opera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Now, this is no other than the apt Type and prefiguring Promise of what Christ will be to his New-begotten in the Resurrection, when <hi>Corruption shall be swallowed up of Glory and Mortal of Immortality.</hi> The same bless<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed Body which, for the Redemption of commiserated Sinners, went through the shameful and bloody Process of Scourges, Thorns, Spittings, and Buffettings; which hung six agonizing Hours on the Cross; which descended into the Grave, and thence opened the Way through Death into Life, and through Time into Eternity; Even this Body shall then shine forth in ineffable
<pb n="241" facs="242" rend="none"/>Beauty and Beatitude, in effentially com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>municative Grace and Glory; through the Heighth and through the Depth, through the Length and through the Breadth, beam<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing wide beyond the Universe, from In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finity to Infinity.</p>
            <p>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, will then become co-embodied in this divine Body; they will be the Repletion of it, they will operate all Things by it. To bring the Creator nearer to his Creatures, the invi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible Godhead will then become visible, the Infinite circumscribed, the Unapproachable accessable, and the Incomprehensible com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehended, within the Humanity of our CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Then will his Cross be exalted, for an Ensign to the circling, bending, and wor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shipping Universe. His Wreath of Thorns will kindle all Nature with the Dartings and Castings forth of its Corruscations. And his Reed of Mockery will become the Sceptre of unlimited Domination.</p>
            <p>From his five Wounds shall be poured forth incessant Floods of Glory and wide diffusing Blessedness upon all his Redeem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed. Adoring Worlds, in self-Abjection, shall strive to sink beneath the Abjection that became their Salvation. These ever apparent Ensigns of so dearly purchased
<pb n="242" facs="243" rend="none"/>Benefits shall inevitably attract the Wills of all Creatures, they shall cause all Hearts and Affections to rush and cleave to him, as Steel Dust rushes to Adamant, and as Spokes stick in the Nave whereon they are centred. There shall be no Lapse thence-forward, forward, no Falling away, for ever. But God in his Christ, and Christ in his Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deemed, shall be a Will and a Wisdom, and an Action and a Mightiness, and a Goodness and a Graciousness, and a Glory rising on Glory, and a Blessing rising on Blessedness, through an ever beginning to a never ending ETERNITY.</p>
            <p>O Brother, Brother, Brother! exclaimed the Earl, I am enraptured, I am entranced! — I see it all, I feel it all. I am already, with all my Corruptions, with all my Transgressions, desirous of being crush<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed to Nothing under the Foot of my Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deemer. But he comforts instead of crush<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing me. O that I were this Night, this very Moment to be dissolved and to be with my Christ!</p>
            <p>That Night, the Earl was quite happy and pleasant, and affectionate even beyond his Custom. He said and did every Thing that could be endearing to his <hi>Harry</hi> and to his Friends. He caressed them at part<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing for Bed. He smilingly shook Hands with all the Domestics that approached
<pb n="243" facs="244" rend="none"/>him; and, in the Morning, was found dead, without any Notice or Warning to the Servants who attended and lay in the Room.</p>
            <p>A sudden and grievous Alarm was in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly given through the Family, and quickly reached the Town, and spread through the adjacent Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> fell upon his Father's Face, and wept upon him, and kissed him, and wept aloud, and kissed him again, crying, my Father, O my Father!</p>
            <p>And they laid his Remains in a plated Coffin, under Escutcheons and a sable Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nopy of Velvet. And the House and the Court was circled with Mourners from all Parts. And they mourned for him fifty and nine Days. And, on the sixtieth Day, he was deposited in his Family Tomb; but Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> would not permit <hi>Harry</hi> to at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tend the Funeral of his Father.</p>
            <p>Our Hero was now the Master of Millions, approaching to the Prime of Youth, glow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing with Health, Action and Vigour, of Beauty incomparable, beloved of All who knew him, and the Attraction and Admi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration of every Eye where he passed. Yet all these Advantages, with all his higher
<pb n="244" facs="245" rend="none"/>Accomplishments, became as Matters of no Value, they sunk and sickened to his Sense, while he felt a Void in his Bosom, eager after he knew not what, sighing he knew not why; keen and craving in his Desires, yet pining and languid in the Want of Possession.</p>
            <p>What is the Matter, my Love? said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> my dear Brother died in a good old Age. Such Things should be expect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, we know that they must be, and we ought not to grieve as Persons who are without Hope.</p>
            <p>True, Sir, said <hi>Harry,</hi> and yet it is a very melancholy Thing for a poor Man to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flect how very rich he was a very little while ago. I lately had a dear Brother, a dear Mother, and the dearest of Fathers, but where are they All now? I look round the World and see nothing but yourself therein. And — should you too — should you too — Here <hi>Harry</hi> could no more. His Uncle also broke into Tears, at the Thoughts of parting with his Dar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ling <hi>Harry,</hi> though it were to join his <hi>Louisa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Harry,</hi> says he at last, we have yet two precious Treasures left upon Earth, if we did but know where to find them; it is your Cousin the Countess of <hi>Maitland,</hi>
               <pb n="245" facs="246" rend="none"/>and the Brother of my <hi>Louisa</hi> the Marquis <hi>D'Aubigny.</hi> Let us go in Search of them, my Son. Next to my <hi>Louisa</hi> they are the loveliest of all Living. They abound in all human and divine Affections, and will caress us with kindred and corresponding Hearts.</p>
            <p>Soon after, they set out for <hi>France</hi> and, by a roundabout Tour of short but pleasant Journeys, arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Clin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ton</hi> ordered his large Retinue to his ancient Inn, and, taking only two Footmen, he and <hi>Harry</hi> went in their Post-Chaise to the Marquis's Palace.</p>
            <p>On the ringing of the Bell and the opening of the Gate, a single Domestic came forth. Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> perceived that all was dark in the Hall, and this instantly gave an Alarm to his ever ready Feelings.</p>
            <p>He alighted, however, and, stepping with his <hi>Harry,</hi> up the Flight of Marble, Where is your Master, says he, where is my Brother the Marquis? Heaven bless us, cried the Fellow, are you my Master's Brother? I have heard a Deal of and about your Lordship, though I never was so hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>py as to see your Face before. Ho! he continued, and rung another Bell, come All of You! attend the Brother of your
<pb n="246" facs="247" rend="none"/>Lord, attend the present Master and Lord of your Houshold!</p>
            <p>Immediately the Palace was in Commo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, the Parlour and Hall were lighted up, and All seemed to have acquired a Set of Wings to their Motions.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> looked with Eagerness at Each of the Domestics, endeavouring to recollect the Features of some old Acquain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance, but all the Faces were strange to him. Pray tell me, my Friends, says he, where is your Master, where and how are he and his Lady, are they still in good Health, has he had any Children by her?</p>
            <p>Please your Honour, said an elderly Man, my Master's first Lady died of Child<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>birth, and her Infant perished with her. But, he is since married to One of the love<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liest Women in the World. He is gone, a Year since, on an Embassy into <hi>Africa;</hi> his Lady would not be left behind, we lately heard from them, they are Both in Health; and we expect that less than a Month will bring them safe to us; indeed, the Sum of our Prayers is for their happy and speedy Return.</p>
            <p>What, said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> are there none of my old Friends, not one of our ancient Domestics to the fore? — Please your
<pb n="247" facs="248" rend="none"/>Lordship, <hi>Jacome,</hi> the white headed Steward, is still left, but, though in good Health, he is very little more than half alive. — Pray go and tell him that an old Friend of his is here, and would be very glad to see him, but don't do Things suddenly, and be very tender and careful in bringing him to me.</p>
            <p>Old <hi>Jacome</hi> was wheeled in, wrinkled, pale, and paralytic, and all enfeebled as he sat reclining in an easy Chair, he seemed to recover Life and new Spirits, as they brought him forward. Bring me to him, bring me to him; my Eyes are wondrous dim; bring me closer, that I may know if it is my very Master indeed. Bring me but once to know that it is his sweet par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doning Face and then let me die with all my Sins upon me, I care not.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> then took him very lovingly by the Hand, my good Friend <hi>Jacome,</hi> says he, we are both growing old I find, I rejoice however to see you once more up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on Earth. O, cried the old Man, a well known and a sweet tuned Voice is that Voice; it is you then, it is you yourself, my Master! Alas, for all your Losses since last we parted! I have got a salt Rheum in my Eyes of late, and I never thought of you but it began to come down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="249" rend="none"/>
Here <hi>Jacome,</hi> sobbing aloud, provoked the joint Tears of his attending fellow Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vants; though they had never been Par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>takers in the foregone Calamities, farther than by the Ear, whence they were now re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>collected and carried home to their Hearts.</p>
            <p>My Lord, says <hi>Jacome</hi> at last, I am not the only One that remains of your old Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vants. Your <hi>Gerard</hi> too, who (Blessings on his Hands) once tied me Neck and Heels, <hi>Gerard</hi> too is forthcoming and near at Hand. Your Honour's wonderful Bounty made a Gentlemen of him at once, and he is now in a high Way with a Wife and three Children. A hundred and a hundred Times have we washed your Remembrance with our Tears. And indeed I think your Honour ought not to send for him, lest he should suddenly die or run distracted at your Sight.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, One of the Lacqueys had officiously gone and informed <hi>Gerard</hi> of the Arrival of his Patron. He came panting, and rushed forward, as it were to cast himself at the Feet of his Lord. But stopping suddenly, and drawing back some Steps, he nailed his Eyes, as it were, on the Face of Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and spreading his Hands, cried:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="250" rend="none"/>
You live then, my Lord, you still live, my dearest Master! you survive all your Deaths and Sufferings, and the Weight of ten Mountains has not been able to crush you! — O, the Times, the Times, my Mas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter, never more to return! — will there be such Times in Heaven, think you? — Will there be such Angels there as we once lived with upon Earth?</p>
            <p>Here he clapped his Hands together, and set up such a Shout of bitter Lamentation, as was enough to split the Heart of every Hearer, and, in a Manner, to split the Graves of the Persons whom he deplored.</p>
            <p>As soon as Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and his two old Friends had parted, for the Night: Tell me, my dear Sir, said <hi>Harry,</hi> are there different Kinds of Grief, or is it, merely, that Grief affects us in different Manners?</p>
            <p>When I wept for my dear Father, my Mother and Brother, my Affliction was anguishing and altogether bitter, without any Species of alleviating Sensation to com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pensate my Misery. But, it was far other<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wise with me to Night; when I grieved in the Grief of your old and faithful Do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mestics, I felt my Heart breaking, but I was pleased that it should break; I felt that it was my Happiness so to grieve; and I
<pb n="250" facs="251" rend="none"/>could wish a Return of the same sweet Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sations.</p>
            <p>The Reason is this, my Love: When you lamented your Parents, you lamented Yourself in your private and personal Losses. Your Affliction was just, it was natural, it was laudable. But still it was confined, it participated but little of the Emotion that is excited by the Affliction of Others, and the Anguish was the keener by being nearly limited to your own Bosom and your own Concerns.</p>
            <p>But, in the Griefs of my old and loving Servants, this Night; you became wholly expanded; you went beyond, you went out of yourself. You felt, without Reflec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, how delightful it is to go forth, with your God, in his social, generous, noble, and divine Sensibilities. And you delight<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fully felt, my <hi>Harry,</hi> that such a House of Mourning is more joyous to your Soul, than all the Festivals that Flesh and Sense can open before you.</p>
            <p>And now, my Child, I will finally, and once for all, lay open the very horrible and detestable Nature of SELF in your Soul.</p>
            <p>SELF appears to us, as the Whole of our Existence, as the Sum total of All, in
<pb n="251" facs="252" rend="none"/>which we are interested or concerned. It is as a NARCISSUS, self-delighted, self-enamoured. It desires, it craves, and claims, as its Right, the Loves, Attach<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, and Respects of all Mankind. But, does it acquire them, my <hi>Harry?</hi> O, ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver, never. SELF never was beloved, ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver will be beloved, never was honourable or respectable in the Eye of any Creature. And the Characters of the <hi>Patriot,</hi> the <hi>Hero,</hi> the <hi>Friend,</hi> and the <hi>Lover,</hi> are only so far amiable, so far revereable, as they are sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed to have gone forth from the Confines of SELF.</p>
            <p>As Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> proposed to wait the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn of the Marquis, he employed the mean Season in Endeavours to amuse his Darling, and to dispel the Cloud of Melancholy that continued to hang over him.</p>
            <p>For this Purpose, he went with him to <hi>Versailles,</hi> and to the many other elegant Environs of <hi>Paris.</hi> He also shewed him the <hi>Thuilleries</hi> and other public Walks, where our Hero became oppressed by his involuntary Attraction of all Eyes upon him.</p>
            <p>One Night, happening to go to the Play, without the Company of his Guardian, as he came forth, with the Crowd, a Carriage
<pb n="252" facs="253" rend="none"/>was opened for him which he took to be his own, and in he stepped, and away he was taken.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> waited Supper for him, and began to grow un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>easy when the Clock struck Twelve. At last his Carriage and Servants returned with Tidings that they staid for him, above an Hour, at the Theatre, after the Play was over, and had ever since been in Search of him, to no Purpose.</p>
            <p>Though Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> was, by Nature, of an intrepid Spirit, and was still more assur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed by his Reliance on Providence, he yet found himself agitated in a very alarming Manner. He therefore retired to his Clo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>set, and there, on his Knees, fervently commended his <hi>Harry</hi> to the Protection of his God.</p>
            <p>At length the Clock struck Three. Soon after, the Bell was heard from the Hall, and <hi>Harry,</hi> entering, with a Page in a rich Livery, flew like Lightening up Stairs, and cast himself into the Bosom of his Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tron.</p>
            <p>My Father, my Father! he cried, I have been in sad Pannics for you. I knew the Love that you bore to your good for no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
<pb n="253" facs="254" rend="none"/>
               <hi>Harry.</hi> But, indeed I could not help it. I could not get to you till this Instant. I have been a Prisoner, Sir, and here is my dear Deliverer.</p>
            <p>As soon as they were something com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed, and All seated; <hi>Harry</hi> proceeded to satisfy the Impatience of his Uncle.</p>
            <p>As I came out of the Theatre, ruminat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing on a Passage in one of <hi>Racine</hi>'s Trage<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dies, I found a Chariot in the Spot where I had left my own, and stepping heedlesly into it, I was soon set down, and hastening through the great Hall, flew up Stairs to salute you. But, think how I was sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prised, when I suddenly found myself in the most sumptuous Chamber, perhaps, in the Universe. It was wainscotted with Mirrors of the most perfect Polish, whose Plates were artfully buttoned and buckled together by Diamonds and other Gems of a most dazzling Lustre.</p>
            <p>All astonished, I recoiled, and was going to withdraw, when I was met by a Lady who followed and accosted me. Have you Commands, Sir, says she, for any One in this House?—A thousand Pardons, Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dam, I perceive my Error! I really thought I was set down at my own Lodgings.—No great Offence, Sir, but now that I
<pb n="254" facs="255" rend="none"/>look at you again, I think you ought to pay the Forfeit of your Intrusion, by giving me one Hour of your Company, at least.—You must excuse me, Madam, my Guardian would be under the most terrify<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Alarms for me.—A Fig for Guar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dians, she cried, You are now my Prisoner, and nothing less than my Friend <hi>Lewis,</hi> with his Army at his Back, shall be able to take you out of my Hands.</p>
            <p>So saying, she rung a Bell, and, imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diately a folding Door of pannelled looking-Glass flew open, and shewed us to another Apartment, where a Supper, composed of all the Elegancies of the Season, was served up, as by Magic, and lay fuming on the Table.</p>
            <p>She then took me by the Hand and, having graciously seated me, placed her<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self opposite. A Number of Servants then vanished, on the Instant, leaving a dumb Waiter of Silver behind them.</p>
            <p>Sir, said she, we are not to have any further Company. You alone were ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pected, you alone are desired, All Others are forbidden. In short, I have seen you often at the public Walks and Theatres. You did more than strike my Fancy, you laid hold on my Heart. I enquired every Thing about you. I know your Rank,
<pb n="255" facs="256" rend="none"/>Title and Fortune. I made use of this Night's Stratagem to decoy you to me, and, though there are few Women, in <hi>Europe,</hi> of equal Opulence or Dignity, I think I cannot much demean myself by an Alliance with a sweet Fellow whom I so ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dently love. But come, our Supper cools.</p>
            <p>I gazed at her with Admiration. She was indeed the most finished Beauty I ever beheld. And I was inwardly flattered, and in a Manner attached to her by her Partia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity in my Favour.</p>
            <p>After Supper, and some futile and insig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nificant Chat, she drew her Chair nearer to me. What say you, my Lord, says she, fondly, am I to live, or to perish?</p>
            <p>Ah Madam, I cried, Love is, as a little Bird, if you cage it, it will beat itself to Pieces against its Prison. Not that I re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard your late Threats of Confinement; my own Arm is at all Times sufficient to deliver me from your Thraldom; but, in Truth, I am partly become a willing Pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>soner to You; and Time may, possibly, reconcile me to your different Customs.</p>
            <p>What Customs, I pray you? Why, Madam, the Ladies, in my Country, use no Paint, except the Rouge of Nature's
<pb n="256" facs="257" rend="none"/>Blush and the Paleness of Chastity. Love also, in <hi>England,</hi> is a Kind of Warfare be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween the Sexes, just such as once happen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed between the <hi>Parthians</hi> and old <hi>Rome;</hi> our Ladies conquer, by flying, and our Men are vanquished while they pursue.</p>
            <p>Persons, Sir, of a certain Rank, said she, are dispensed with from conforming to little Matters of Decorum. However, if you will endeavour to adopt the Manners of my Country, I will do my best, on my Part, to conform to those of Yours.</p>
            <p>So saying, she looked languishingly at me, and drew her Chair quite close; when, by an involuntary Motion, I put mine further back. Don't be alarmed, my Lord, says she, Women of my Condition know always where to stop. Right, Madam, said I, but possibly you might not be quite so success<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful in teaching me where to be stopped.</p>
            <p>Cold constitutioned Boy! she cried (in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dignantly rising and colouring) your Bed lies yonder, you may go to it, if you like, and ruminate till Morning on the Danger of slighting and insulting a Princess. So saying, she swept haughtily out of the Room, and locked me in.</p>
            <p>During an Hour after she had withdrawn, while I walked about, considering what I
<pb n="257" facs="258" rend="none"/>had to apprehend from the Threats of this extraordinary Woman, I hear'd a great Bustling in and about the Falace; but, within another Hour All was quiet and still again.</p>
            <p>I then conceived Thoughts of attempting my Escape. But again, I held it beneath me to be caught in the Manner; and so I resolved to wait till Morning, and then to force my Passage through her Guards in open Day.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, I imagined that a Pannel in the Wainscot stirred. And, soon after, it was removed, and my young Friend, here, entered my Chamber on Tiptoe. He beckoned me to Silence and, taking me by the Hand, he led me through the Way by which he came.</p>
            <p>We then descended a narrow Pair of back Stairs, and, groping along a dark Entry, he cautiously unbolted a Door that opened into a Garden; and hurrying with me, across, he unlocked another Door that opened to the Street, and out we got, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>joicing!</p>
            <p>Soon after, we met a Party of the Guards, who were patroling the Streets, and, putting a few Pieces into their Hand,
<pb n="258" facs="259" rend="none"/>I requested their safe Convoy, and they conducted us Home.</p>
            <p>My Lords, said <hi>Perrè,</hi> (for that was the Page's Name) it would be extremely dange<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous for Ye to remain another Day, or even till Morning in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Princess is the most intimate Friend of Madame <hi>Mainte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>non,</hi> and through her can do what she pleases with the King. During my Resi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence with her, she grew tired of two hand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>some Lovers, in Succession; but they told no Tales; and no One can yet tell what became of them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> was quite of <hi>Perrè</hi>'s Opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion. He instantly sent for his People. All was Hurry, Pack and Dispatch, and, toward Dawning, they set out on a Road that led to the Cantons. But, changing their Course again, for several successive Mornings, they arrived at <hi>Calais</hi> by a long Tour of near five Weeks travel.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> set up at his old Inn, and after Dinner, the Host entered to pay his Compliments. Have you any News, Land<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lord? Nothing at present, my Lord, all is quiet again. But here has been a fearful Bustle about three Weeks ago. The King's Army came down, in Pursuit of young <hi>Englishman</hi> who ran away with a La<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy
<pb n="259" facs="260" rend="none"/>of Quality from <hi>Paris.</hi> For my Share, continued he, looking earnestly at <hi>Harry,</hi> I fear that You, pretty <hi>English</hi> Lads, will hardly leave us a lovely Wench in the Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion. <hi>Harry</hi> looked quite secure, being wholly innocent of any present Design on the Sex; but poor little <hi>Perrè</hi> turned as pale as the Table Cloth.</p>
            <p>I remember, continued our talkative Host, that just such another Affair hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pened, when I was a Boy and Servant in this House. Here came a young <hi>English<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man,</hi> just such another sweet Fellow as this before me; and he brought with him an Angel of a Creature, the like of whom my Eyes never did, nor ever shall open upon till they close in Death. After him came one of our great Dukes, with a Party of the King's Army, and terrible Things were expected. But, they made it up in a Manner I know not how. And my Lord <hi>Anglois</hi> carried off his Prize in Triumph! Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> stooped his Head, and dropt a silent Tear, but held no further Converse with our Landlord on the Subject.</p>
            <p>That Evening, a Gale sprung up and, going on Board, they were safe anchored, before Morning, in the Bay of <hi>Dover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They then mutually embraced; and <hi>Harry,</hi> catching his beloved Deliverer to
<pb n="260" facs="261" rend="none"/>his Bosom, we are now upon <hi>English</hi> Ground, says he; welcome to my Arms, my dear <hi>Perrè,</hi> no longer my Page or Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vant, but my Friend and my Brother! You can't conceive what Pain your Offici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ousness has hitherto cost me, but, there must be no more of this; You shall here<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>after be served and attended as I am, nay, I myself will gladly serve You to the utmost of my Power and the Extent of my For<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune.</p>
            <p>Ah, my Lord, cried the lovely <hi>Perrè,</hi> gently falling at the Feet of his Master, if you deprive me of the Pleasure of serving You, you deprive me of all the Pleasure that the World can afford me. If you knew the Delight I find in being always about you, in watching your Thoughts and Motions, in looking into your fine Eyes and there reading your Desires, before they rise to Expression, You could not find in your Heart to deprive me of such a Bless<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing. Well then, said <hi>Harry,</hi> raising him fondly in his Arms, our future Contest shall be, which of us shall serve the Other with most Affection and Sedulity.</p>
            <p>After Dinner, the Evening being calm and shiny, <hi>Harry</hi> took his <hi>Perrè</hi> with him along the Shore that stretches under the stupendous Cliffs of <hi>Dover.</hi> They had not
<pb n="261" facs="262" rend="none"/>walked far when, getting out of the Sight of People within the Winding of a Creek, a Man advanced toward them, and, taking out a Pistol, called to <hi>Harry,</hi> and ordered him to throw down his Purse. Our Hero did not regard his Purse, but, thinking it an Indignity to be robbed by one Man, he put his Hand to his Sword. Hereupon, the Villain cocked and levelled his Pistol, and the faithful <hi>Perrè,</hi> observing that he was going to fire, instantly jumped in be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween her Master and Danger and received the Ball into her own lovely Bosom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> saw his Darling drop, and, flying all enraged at the Robber, he ran him thrice through the Body and pinned him to the Ground. Then, flying as swiftly back, he threw himself by the Side of his dying <hi>Perrè,</hi> and gently raising her lan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guishing Head, placed it fondly on his Bosom.</p>
            <p>You are wounded, my Friend, dange<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rously wounded I fear, says <hi>Harry.</hi> Yes, my Lord, I am wounded just as I could wish; and I would not exchange my pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ent blessed Death for the longest and hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piest Life that the World could bestow.—But, it is Time to undeceive, and eveal a Secret to you, which nothing but death should ever have extorted from me
<pb n="262" facs="263" rend="none"/>—I am not what I seem, my most beloved Master!—I am a foolish and fond Girl who, at the first Glance, con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived a Passion for you.—My Name is <hi>Maria de Lausanne;</hi>—I am Niece to that bad Woman whom you justly rejected.—But, what did I propose by this Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guise? First your Deliverance, my Lord, and that I effected.—But, did I fur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther aspire to the Honour of your Hand? Far from it, far from it—I felt my own Unworthiness, I did not think you could be mated by any Thing less than an An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gel—But then to see you, to hear you, to serve, to touch, to be near you, to fix my Eyes on you unheeded, and, if possi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble, to win your Attention by the little Offices of my Fondness, this was my Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness, the Whole of the Heaven that I proposed upon Earth—I have had it, I have enjoyed it;—and I ought to die content—But, alas, to part from you, there is the Pang of Pangs.—O, if this Day merits any Thing, by the Offer of my own Life for the Preservation of my Beloved.—Then cause my chaste Clay to be kindly deposited in the Tomb of your Ancestors—that—when Time shall come—my Dust may be neigh boured—to your precious Dust—and there sleep in Peace—beside you—till we spring—together—from
<pb n="263" facs="264" rend="none"/>Corruption—into Glory and Immor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tality!</p>
            <p>During these short Sentences and diffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cult Respirations, <hi>Harry</hi> could answer no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing—He was suffocated by his Grief.—But, putting his speechless Lips to the fading Lips of his <hi>Maria,</hi> he drew her latest Breath into his own affecti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>onate Bosom, and Angels instantly caught her Spirit into the Regions of Purity, of Love, and of Faith unfailing!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry,</hi> then, plucking up Strength from Oppression, and Courage from Despair, pressed his Lips to the pale, and unfeeling Lips of his true Lover, and cried, Yes, my <hi>Maria,</hi> our Dust shall be joined, and I feel that our Spirits too shall shortly be wed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ded!—Then, raising her in his Arms, and pressing her to his Bosom, he bore her to the Town, while he poured upon her, all the Way, the two Fountains of his Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection.</p>
            <p>When he got to the Inn, and came to is Uncle; Here, Sir, said he, I present you with a very precious little Burden, a Bur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den that lies much heavier on my Heart than <gap resp="#uom" extent="1 word" rend="content:〈◊〉">
                  <desc>illegible</desc>
               </gap> did in my Arms. He then related to Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> the Whole of what had passed; then, heavily sighing, and shedding a Tear, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> cried, Ah, my <hi>Harry,</hi> I would
<pb n="264" facs="265" rend="none"/>to Heaven that your <hi>Maria</hi> had lived, She exceeds your <hi>Aggy Jessamin</hi> all to nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> ordered a Carriage, on Purpose, for himself and his Beloved. She was deposited in a Coffin hurried up for the Oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casion; and, notwithstanding all the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monstrances and Entreaties of his Parent, <hi>Harry</hi> proved a Rebel, for the first Time, and would not be divided from his <hi>Maria,</hi> till they reached <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There, our Hero ordered a Coffin of unallayed and beaten Silver to be prepared for her Reception. And, tho' near five Days had passed since the Departure of her Spirit, her chaste Flesh remained as pure and untainted, as that of a Lamb newly slain.</p>
            <p>While they were putting her into her solemn Repository. Ah, Sir, said <hi>Harry,</hi> I pretend not to compare with you, your Losses, I own, have been greater than mine. You are a Man, like your divine Master, wholly made up of Sorrows and acquainted with killing Griefs. But still you must allow that, for my little Time I have had a competent Share. It matter not. I am reconciled to them. I begin to be pleased with them. And indeed Joy is become my utter Aversion, while I think
<pb n="265" facs="266" rend="none"/>on this loved Creature, who willingly bled and died for my Sake.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Harry</hi> thought it his Duty, so he thought it would be his Delight to weep and lament his <hi>Maria</hi> for ever. But Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions seldom are permanent, and Time, though it may not wholly efface, daily wears away an insensible Portion of the deepest Impressions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> caused the Coffin of his Deliverer to be exalted on a Cabinet in his Bedcham<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber, that it might be always in his Sight. But the Familiarity of affecting Objects daily lessens their Force; and <hi>Harry,</hi> Week after Week, began to contemplate the Repository of the loved Remains of his <hi>Maria,</hi> with abating Affliction.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> received a Letter, by the <hi>French</hi> Mail, in answer to One which he had left for his Brother-in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>law, at <hi>Paris.</hi> And, this Letter informed him, under the Marquis's Hand, that he had returned from his Ambassy to the Court of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and that he and his Lady would be shortly in <hi>England.</hi> And, at the Bot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tom he found written, in a different Charac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter, <hi>Will it be any Satisfaction to see them ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>companied by your once loved</hi>—FANNY GOODALL.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="267" rend="none"/>
We have found them, my <hi>Harry,</hi> he cried, we have found them, our long and far sought Friends; the two Treasures which our God had graciously laid in Store, for the Comfort of us poor People who lost All beside. But, don't let us do them the Disgrace, my Son, of meeting and receiv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing them with Tears and Dirges. Let me then prevail upon you to permit your faith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful <hi>Perrè</hi> to be conducted by some of our People, with an honourable Train of Un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dertakers to <hi>Enfield,</hi> and there to be trea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sured up in your Family Vault, where I shall speedily join her, and whereto even my <hi>Harry</hi> must finally adjourn.—<hi>Harry</hi> wiped his Eye and said, be it as you please, my Father!</p>
            <p>Within the following Fortnight, as our Hero stood with a single Attendant in <hi>Cheap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>side</hi> overagainst the <hi>Devil Tavern,</hi> where the Club, called <hi>Legion Club,</hi> was kept; he was accosted by a glittering Appearance, who took him by the Hand and said, How are you, Master <hi>Fenton?</hi>—Well, Sir, I thank you; Lord <hi>Bottom</hi> I presume!—The same, Sir—And pray how are the worthy Lord and Lady <hi>Mansfield,</hi> as also your lovely Sister, the Lady <hi>Louisa?</hi>—Passable, Sir; but what makes you in black? I hope Mr. <hi>Fenton</hi> is still in the Land of the Living.—He is, my Lord.
<pb n="267" facs="268" rend="none"/>But Black is a cheap Kind of Wear, it is a Matter of Frugality to kill a Cousin once in a Twelve-month.—Well, be that as it may, I insist on your stepping over the Way to take one Glass with me—Your Lordship must excuse me, I am go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to the Wharf, to enquire concerning some Friends whom I expect from <hi>France.</hi> O, I protest, Master <hi>Fenton,</hi> you shall not disappoint me, I insist on renewing our old Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> could hardly have found it in his Heart to refuse the Request of an avowed Enemy, much less could he think of re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jecting an Invitation that was made under a warm Appearance of Friendship.</p>
            <p>When Lord <hi>Bottom</hi> had seated his old Enemy (as he still supposed him to be) in the Midst of fourteen or fifteen Bloods and Bucks, <hi>Harry</hi> would gladly have retreated; but rejected the Thought, lest they should think that he was intimidated.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, cried Lord <hi>Bottom,</hi> give me Leave to introduce a Phenomenon to you, my Friend yonder is a CHRISTIAN! A Christian, cried One; a Christian, cried Another? Ay, said Lord <hi>Bottom,</hi> a Chris<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tian of the right Cast, he literally conforms to the Example of his Master. If you
<pb n="268" facs="269" rend="none"/>smite him on the one Cheek, he will turn the Other to you, and you cannot delight him more than by Kickings, Spittings, and Spurnings.</p>
            <p>Pray Sir, said One of the Company, are you actually a Christian? I hope so, Sir, said <hi>Harry.</hi> And may I spit in your Face, Sir, said Another, without Fear of Chas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tisement? You may, Sir, said <hi>Harry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told ye so, Gentlemen, I told ye so, exclaimed Lord <hi>Bottom.</hi> I have myself put the Christianity of my Friend there to the Proof. I have made him the But and the Jest of all Companies. I have dubbed him with the Title of FOOL. I have pasted it on his Back in Capitals, in the Midst of the Levee, and in the Presence of his Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jesty. And yet, he never shewed the least Instance of his being offended. For Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ample now, and so saying, he spit directly in <hi>Harry</hi>'s Face.</p>
            <p>Another then, and then Another, and so on, in a numerous Succession spit full at our Hero. While he, without the smallest apparent Emotion, barely took out his Handkerchief and wiped the Moisture from his Face.</p>
            <p>At rength a lusty-looking young Man arore Damn the Rascal, said he, I will
<pb n="269" facs="270" rend="none"/>not demean myself by spitting at him, I will piss upon the Rascal; which he accord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingly prepared to do. But <hi>Harry,</hi> perceiv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing his Approach, turned mildly and said, I do not recollect, Sir, that this was any of the Indignities to which my Lord and Master submitted. Then, without rising from his Seat, he gave him a Knuckle in the Temple which laid him asleep on the Floor.</p>
            <p>'Sbl—d, cried One of the Company, I fear, <hi>Jemmy Bottom,</hi> you have brought us into the wrong Box. You have certainly mistaken your Man.</p>
            <p>He has indeed, said <hi>Harry,</hi> calmly. He calls me <hi>Fenton,</hi> but my Name is not <hi>Fenton,</hi> my Name is <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>More<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land;</hi> and you shall, every Man, lie these twelve Months in <hi>Newgate</hi> for this Day's Breach of Privilege against a Peer of the Realm. Here is my Star, Gentlemen; I can put my Riband on at Pleasure.</p>
            <p>The whole <hi>Legion</hi> were instantly struck with mute Terror and Astonishment. They lifted up their Hands, or sunk to their Knees in petitioning Postures. But <hi>Harry</hi> said, with a firm and alarming Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cent, I desire your Reformation, Gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men, and I will endeavour to compleat it.
<pb n="270" facs="271" rend="none"/>I have hitherto, only shewn you the first Part of Christianity in the Example of meek and lowly Sufferance. The second Part remains. It is to teach You, abject Wretches, to suffer in your Turn. How<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever, I am not of a very vindictive Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, and if All of you will be upon Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour to give me your Hands, I will par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don what is past and dismiss you in Suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cession.</p>
            <p>Lord <hi>Bottom</hi> and his Friend <hi>Rakely</hi> were the first who advanced, lowly bowing, to claim the proposed Terms of Peace, when <hi>Harry,</hi> seizing <hi>Bottom</hi>'s Hand with a strong and agile Gripe, crushed the Bones and the Grisles as it were into one Mass, and <hi>Bot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tom,</hi> giving a huge Scream, dropt roaring on the Floor. <hi>Rakely</hi> then would have re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>coiled, but <hi>Harry,</hi> catching at him, sent him to join his Brother in Iniquity and Affliction on the Boards.</p>
            <p>Well, Gentlemen, said <hi>Harry,</hi> what keeps you in your Seats? Why do ye not come and give me the Honour of your Hands as was agreed? If you do not do it directly, I will take Each of you, very quietly, by the Nose, and kick you through the Crowd of Attendants down Stairs.</p>
            <p>My Lord, cried One of the Company, I will not give you my Hand, neither shall
<pb n="271" facs="272" rend="none"/>any Man living take me by the Nose. So saying he sprung up, and catching at his Sword, which lay with Others on a Table, he hastily drew it and stood on his Defence.</p>
            <p>O fye, Sir, said <hi>Harry,</hi> without moving from his Seat, you don't put yourself in a Posture. Any Man, who was not a very good natured Man, might take you at an Advantage, and run you under the Open that you give to your right Flank. But Sir, said <hi>Harry,</hi> rising, I will only caution you by a little Puncture in the Sword Arm; I don't mean you much Hurt. And, so saying, he passed his Sword through the Flesh of his Adversary's right Arm, and, taking him to the Door, he wished him a good Evening, and turned him down Stairs to seek for a Surgeon.</p>
            <p>He then returned to the Company, and, taking Each of the intimidated Wretches (in Succession) by the Nose; he led them out, and footed them down Stairs, through the Midst of their own Servants, the Wait<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> crying, a Kicking to all the infa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mous and scoundrel Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> who dare to spit at Christianity!</p>
            <p>Then, calling two of the Drawers, Here is something for yourselves, my Lads, says he; and here I leave you yonder Swords and these two very fine Gentlemen in pawn
<pb n="272" facs="273" rend="none"/>for your Reckoning. So saying, he walk<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed quite composedly away, through the Midst of two long Ranges of bowing Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mirers, who lined the Stairs and the Entry, and thus <hi>Harry</hi> dissolved the <hi>Legion Club.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Morning early before Mr. <hi>Clin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ton</hi> was up, while <hi>Harry</hi> sat sipping a Dish of Tea, dressed in a dark grey Frock, his Hair slightly bound up after the Footman Fashion, and his long Staff of quarter cleft Oak, without Knot or Flaw, standing po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lished beside him, Mr. <hi>Frank</hi> introduced a young Man, whom he recommended to his Lordship's Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> measured him, with a Glance, from Top to Toe, and was instantly struck by the visible Action, Power, and Energy of his Proportions.</p>
            <p>Sit down, <hi>Frank,</hi> says <hi>Harry,</hi> while your Friend and I treat. What is your Name, my Lad? <hi>John Sutton,</hi> so please you. And what Wages do you desire? From one Pound to one hundred yearly. — A great Difference indeed, <hi>John.</hi> — Why, please your Honour, if I mayn't happen to like you I shall march without asking a single Penny. But if I should have the Misfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune to love you, as your Countenance threatens, I shall certainly deserve the
<pb n="273" facs="274" rend="none"/>whole of my Demand, by All that I shall do, and dare to do in your Service.</p>
            <p>Can you wrestle, <hi>Jack?</hi> — When<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever your Honour shall get a Man, through the Shires of <hi>England,</hi> who is able to fling me, I will serve you the Remainder of my Life for nothing. Can you cudgel, <hi>Jack?</hi> — I was born a Fencer, so please your Lordship, my Father was a famous Prize<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fighter, and my Mother could beat my Father himself at the Quarter Staff. — Did you ever read the History of <hi>Robin Hood, Jack?</hi> — I did, Sir. — Then you may remember that honest <hi>Robin</hi> never took an Abettor into Pay, save such a One as was able to cope with himself. <hi>Frank</hi> here shall sit and see fair Play.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then rose, and taking two Sticks, gave one of them to his Opponent, then, putting a Brass Helmet upon <hi>Jack</hi>'s Head, there is something, said he, to save you from Hurt, and now, come at the Thick<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of my Skull as fast as you can!</p>
            <p>To it they strait fell, with equal Confi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence of Ability. But <hi>Harry,</hi> perceiving that <hi>Jack</hi> intended to spare him, cried, Come, <hi>Jack,</hi> the best, the very best that you can do, or not a Penny, a single Penny of Wages, I assure you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="274" facs="275" rend="none"/>
               <hi>Jack</hi> then exerted his utmost, and put nearly the fullest Powers of our Hero to Proof, till <hi>Harry,</hi> dazzling his Eyes by a sudden Flourish, gave him a smart Stroke on his brazen Head-piece, and drove him stunned and staggering several Paces back<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward, till he rested against the Wall that stood behind him.</p>
            <p>Ha, said <hi>Jack,</hi> recovering, and casting his Cap aside, that indeed was a Blow which neither my Father nor Mother ever taught me to fence.</p>
            <p>Well, my Friend, said our Hero, as soon as you are rested, we must have a little Turn or so at Wrestling. No, no, cried <hi>Jack,</hi> I would not advise your Lordship to that, there lies all my Excellence, the very best of my Manhood. Well, <hi>Jack,</hi> said <hi>Harry,</hi> a Fling on this Floor can't hurt us a Whit more than a Fall on the Downs.</p>
            <p>They closed, they grappled, they griped under and over, at Hip and at Shoulder, alternately lifting and lifted, till they were nearly overbreathed. Then, parting for a Moment, they rushed forward and seized each other by the Breast, when <hi>Harry,</hi> giv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing his Adversary a sudden Twist on one Side and then an agile Jerk and Foot on the other, cast him sidelong on the Carpet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="276" rend="none"/>
Poor <hi>Jack</hi> rose, astonished and in utter Abasement, ashamed even to lift his Eyes toward the Eyes of his Friend <hi>Frank;</hi> when <hi>Harry</hi> took him by the Hand and forcea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bly seated him at the Tea-table. Come, <hi>Jack,</hi> says he, don't be discouraged. You have put me harder to it than did the great <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Ross-town,</hi> though I think I am much abler than I was at that Day. Here <hi>Frank,</hi> order us something more substantial for Breakfast, while your Friend and I en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deavour to accommodate our Differences.</p>
            <p>When Breakfast was over, <hi>Harry</hi> looked fixedly at his late Opponent and said, I will give you, <hi>Jack,</hi> a little Matter above the Extent of your Demand; I will give you one Hundred a Year for your Cudgelling, another Hundred for your Wrestling; and as you say you can love, I will lay another Hundred in store for you, till that Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mise is put to Proof; and here is twenty Guineas as Earnest of our Agreement. <hi>Jack</hi> then threw himself prostrate before the Feet of his new Master. Keep your Bounties, keep your Bounties for my Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ecutors, he cried, for I feel that, when your Service demands my Life, I shall not survive another Minute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then rose and, putting another Quarter-staff into the Hand of his new Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vant,
<pb n="276" facs="277" rend="none"/>here is a Horse for you, <hi>Jack,</hi> says he, in case you should tire; for we have a long Walk from Pal-Mall here, to the Cus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tom-house Wharf and back again.</p>
            <p>As they drew near the Quay, <hi>Harry</hi> ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>served a great Crowd, all in Motion, and shouting as in the Midst of an Affray. Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mediately he hastened up, and, making way through the Mob, perceived that they were kicking, and wounding, and drag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ging above twenty unhappy Foreigners along the Pavement. While a Lady, who stood with her Women on the Stairs, cried aloud, five hundred, a thousand, five thou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sand Pounds to Any who will save my poor People!</p>
            <p>Come, <hi>Jack,</hi> says our Hero, let us try to deliver these abused Strangers from the Cruelty of our savage Countrymen.</p>
            <p>On the Word, <hi>Harry</hi> found himself well seconded by <hi>Jack,</hi> and, in less than a Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nute, above thirty of the Assailants lay sprawling on the Area; while the wounded and bruised Foreigners arose as well as they could, or crawled and got in a Group to the Feet of their Mistress.</p>
            <p>The Mob, thereupon, rallied, and, ga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thering to the Number of some Hundreds,
<pb n="277" facs="278" rend="none"/>advanced in a formidable Body against our two Champions. But, they had better have kept aloof. For <hi>Harry,</hi> running up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on them, overturned the First he met with one End of his Staff, and laid a Second at his Feet with the Revolution of the other End, insomuch that at every Motion, as it were, he dispatched two Men.</p>
            <p>Neither was <hi>Jack</hi> unactive. The Crowd began to recoil, when, rushing into the Midst, they overthrew such as opposed them, and, whirling their Staffs about their Heads, they quickly opened and cleared large Room for themselves. No One dared to abide within the Wind of their Wea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pons; and the Mob, flying several Ways, left our Hero quiet Master of the Field of Battle.</p>
            <p>Mean time, the Lady stood fixed in utter Astonishment at the Feats which she had seen, when <hi>Harry,</hi> gracefully approach<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, I think myself happy, Madam, says he, in having done some small Service to a Lady of your fair and noble Appearance; of what Country may I presume? Of <hi>England,</hi> Sir, says she, and I am ready to discharge my Promise of five thousand Pounds for the gallant Rescue which you brought to me and my People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="279" rend="none"/>
No, Madam, said our Hero, I will not de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>base the little Merit of my Humanity by the Acceptance of a Bribe. But I shall not be easy till I see You and your Attendants out of the Reach of these <hi>London</hi>-Barbari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ans. They may return with different Wea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pons, and a larger Reinforcement. He then called to some Porters and, throwing them a Parcel of Silver, ordered them to bring all the Coaches they could muster. And go You, <hi>Jack,</hi> says he, to the Ship<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ping, enquire after the Friends that I told you of, and then follow me to the White Cross Tavern in <hi>Cheapside.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Coaches came, and <hi>Harry</hi> assisted his Porters in carrying, helping, and gently stowing the Maimed and the Wounded into half a Dozen of them. He then hand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed in the Lady, and next, coming to a Blackamoor Boy, who had a Coronet of Diamonds inserted in his Cap, he offered to lift him in. But the Youth, bending one Knee to the Dust, and seizing on <hi>Harry</hi>'s Hand, eagerly and repeatedly kissed it, crying out in <hi>French,</hi> heavenly, heavenly Creature! and then, breaking into Tears, sprung into the Coach, and sat down by the Lady.</p>
            <p>Our Hero then bestowed the four female Attendants, with such Luggage as was
<pb n="279" facs="280" rend="none"/>brought on Shore, into the four remaining Coaches. Then, grasping his Quarterstaff, and ordering the Porters to attend, he guarded and escorted All safe to the White Cross.</p>
            <p>The first Thing he then did was to or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der private Apartments for the Lady and her Attendants. He next dispatched the Wait<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers for all the Surgeons in the Neighbour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hood. He then locked the Room where he saw the Luggage safe lodged; ordered a sumptuous Dinner to be prepared as soon as possible; and, lastly, discharged the Coaches and Porters, who poured their parting Blessings upon his Head; and all this he did with wonderful Dispatch, for <hi>Harry</hi> was now in the wide Element of his Bene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficence, as a Whale in the Ocean.</p>
            <p>Four Surgeons then came, and our Hero, putting five Guineas apiece into their Hands, desired them to examine and dress their Patients; and staid till he hear'd the delighting Tidings that None of them were incurable. He then sent up to the Lady to desire Permission to attend her. She rose and met him as he entered; Child of Heaven, said she, from which of the Or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders of Angels have you descended? I have heared as well as seen what you have won<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derfully done for us. Madam, said <hi>Harry,</hi> endeavouring to turn the Discourse, I
<pb n="280" facs="281" rend="none"/>would not advise you to remove your Peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple for some Time: I have ordered Beds and Apartments for them in this House; where those, who are tolerably well, may assist the Doctors to attend their sick Fellows till All shall be restored. In the mean time I have sent to my Father's for his Coach and Chariot to convey You, and this young Gentleman, and your Women, to our House, where you can want for no Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vants, since my Father, and I, and All will be truely and tenderly your Servants. We are your Property, Sir, said the Lady, dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose of us as you please.</p>
            <p>But, pray Madam, said our Hero, what could provoke the Rabble to insult You and Yours, in the Manner that they did this Day? I protest, Sir, said she, I cannot conceive, except it be that, as some One says in LEAR, <hi>our Countenances liked them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a little Time after, Dinner was served up, and <hi>Harry,</hi> happening to turn his Head, perceived the black Youth by stealth kissing the Hat, and pressing the Gloves to his Bosom that he had laid on a Table.</p>
            <p>Whatever the Darkness or Deformity of any Aspect or Person may happen to be, if the sentimental Beauty of Soul shall burst through the Cloud upon us, the Dark be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>comes
<pb n="281" facs="282" rend="none"/>Light, the Deformed quite comely, and we begin to affect what was lately our Aversion. Thus it was that <hi>Harry</hi> found himself suddenly and inevitably attached by the two recent Proofs that this outlandish Youth had given of his Affection.</p>
            <p>Being all seated, <hi>Harry</hi> looked earnestly at the young Moor, and turning to the Lady said: I now perceive, Madam, how ridiculous all Sorts of Prejudices are, and find that Time and Observation may change our Opinions to the Reverse of what they were. I once had an Aversion to all Sorts of Blacks, but I avow that there is something so amiable in the Face of this Youth, and his Eyes cast such a Lustre over the Darkness of his Countenance as is enough, as <hi>Shakespear</hi> has it, to make us in love with Night, and pay no more Wor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship to the gaudy Sun.</p>
            <p>The Moor, hereat, smiled celestial Sweetness, and Joy beamed from his Eyes and throughout his dimpling Aspect.</p>
            <p>But who can you be, my sweet Fellow, said the Lady, who are the Picture, the Image, almost the Thing itself that I was so sadly in love with five and thirty Years ago? Why, Madam, said our Hero, you could not have been born at that early
<pb n="282" facs="283" rend="none"/>Day. Ah you Flatterer, says she, I am turned of Forty. But, pray Madam, who was he that was so happy as to attract your infant Affections? — His Name was <hi>Harry Clinton</hi> — Why, Madam, <hi>Harry Clinton</hi> is my Name. — <hi>Harry Clinton, Harry Clinton!</hi> screamed out the Lady, and started up from her Chair; — Yes, Madam, I am Son to the Earl of <hi>Moreland,</hi> and I almost dare to hope that you were once the enchanting <hi>Fanny Goodall.</hi>—Yes, my lovely Kinsman, I am indeed your <hi>Fanny Goodall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then sprung forward, and seizing her Hand, kept it dwelling on his Lips. But, disengaging it, she opened her Arms and clasped him to her Bosom, and wept over him as a Mother would over a long-lost Son. While the young <hi>Moor</hi> ran and danced about the Room, like a mad Thing, clapping Hands, and springing, like an <hi>Antelope,</hi> almost to the Cieling.</p>
            <p>When they were something composed, the <hi>Moor</hi> caught the Lady about the Neck and kissing her, cried, Joy, Joy, my dear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est Madam, the greatest of all Joys! Then turning to our Hero, he took each of his Hands, in Turns, and pressed them to his Lips, while <hi>Harry,</hi> kissing his Forehead, cried, my Brother, my Brother!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="284" rend="none"/>
When they were again set to Dinner, <hi>Jack</hi> entered. My Lord, says he, I have been all along the Quays and the Shipping, but can learn no Tidings of the Marquis <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> nor of any <hi>French</hi> Family save that of the Dutchess <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who, this Morning, came up the River with a nume<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous Train.</p>
            <p>Well, says <hi>Harry,</hi> our Happiness has been already quite sufficient to the Day. To morrow may crown our Wishes with full Success.</p>
            <p>No, my Love, said the Lady, you can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not see the Marquis for some Time. The Truth is that you find, in me, your <hi>Fanny Goodall,</hi> the Marchioness <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> and the Duchess <hi>de Bouillon.</hi> But these Matters shall be explaimed more clearly, when I am blessed with the Sight of your precious Uncle.</p>
            <p>News was now brought that the Car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riages were at the Door, when, taking a hasty Bit or two, they visited and left Orders for the Care of the Sick and Wound<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, and then set out in a Hurry for <hi>Pal Mall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they arrived, the Dutchess has<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tened in, enquiring for Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and,
<pb n="284" facs="285" rend="none"/>when she came where he was, she cried out, as she advanced, and as he rose to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive her, your <hi>Fanny,</hi> your <hi>Fanny Goodall,</hi> my Cousin! and throwing herself into his Arms, dwelt there for a Minute. Then recoiling awhile, she looked fondly at him and cried, your Sister also, my Brother, your Sister <hi>D'Aubigny!</hi> the Wife of the Brother of your heavenly <hi>Louisa!</hi> then clasping him to her Arms, she broke into Tears; and again, quitting him, sat down to quiet her Emotions.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> having seated himself affec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tionately beside her, said: These are won<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>drous Things that you tell me, my pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious Sister; by what Miracle have these Blessings been brought about?</p>
            <p>I am too much agitated at present, says she, let me have a little Coffee, and the Matter shall be unravelled.</p>
            <p>As they were settling to the Tea-table, give me Leave, Sir, said the Duchess, to introduce my little black Companion to your Notice. He is a sweet Fellow I assure you, notwithstanding his Complexion. He is Child to our royal Friend the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi> who has entrusted him to our Guardianship for his Travel and Education. However he might have come by his sable Outside, his Father, the great <hi>Abenamin,</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="286" rend="none"/>is the least of the tawny of any Man I saw in <hi>Africa,</hi> and his Mother is one of the fairest and finest Women that ever opened a Pair of living Diamonds to the Light; but, she took Fright, while she was preg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nant, at the sudden Sight of a <hi>Blackamoor.</hi> But, my Brother, I shall more particularly recommend him to your Regard, by tell<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing you that he is an exceedingly pious Christian, though as playful as Lambs and as chuckling as Infancy.</p>
            <p>She then turned and, taking the little <hi>Abenamin</hi> by the Hand, led him up and placed him before her Brother. When the Youth, suddenly dropping on his Knees, looked up to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> with Eyes that spoke Love and reverential Awe, and besought his Blessing.</p>
            <p>The old Gentleman found himself sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prizingly affected and, lifting up his Hands, cried, God be gracious to you, my Child, and make your Soul as bright as your Countenance is sable! and may the Sun of Righteousness shine with Power upon you, and soon disperse or illumine every Shade that is about You. The Prince embraced his Legs, kissed his Knees, and arose.</p>
            <p>Soon as the Coffee was removed, You may remember, my dearest Cousin, said
<pb n="286" facs="287" rend="none"/>the Duchess, in what a Hurry I last parted from you. Mr. <hi>Fairface,</hi> with whom the Bulk of my Fortune was deposited, went off with above a hundred thousand Pounds of my Substance, beside four times that Value entrusted to him by Others.</p>
            <p>I traced him to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there he had the Impudence to give me an Interview, but at the same Time had the Impudence to bid me Defiance.</p>
            <p>Immediately I commenced Suit, and sent dispatch to <hi>London</hi> for my Papers and Wit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nesses.</p>
            <p>On the Opening of my Cause in Court, I was summoned by the Title of Countess of <hi>Maitland,</hi> otherwise <hi>Frances Goodall.</hi> On hearing the Name, a Gentleman who was near me started, and turning and coming up, Pray, Madam, says he, are you any way related to the honourable <hi>Harry Clinton,</hi> who once went by that Name in this City? I am Sir, said I, almost the nearest Rela<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion that he has upon Earth. — He is, Madam, my dearest Friend and Brother. Pray speak to your Advocates to postpone your Suit for a few Days, till I am inform<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed of the Nature and Merits of your Cause.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="288" rend="none"/>
This was accordingly done. He desired to know where I lodged, and in less than an Hour his Chariot was at my Door.</p>
            <p>Except yourself, my Cousin, the Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quis had the most lovely and winning As<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pect and Person that ever I beheld. I soon convinced him of the Equity of my De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mand and of the Villainy of my Trustee, and made him perfect Master of the whole Affair. But he still continued to visit, and to stay with me a considerable Part of every Day, under Colour of being better inform<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed touching this and t'other Particular, the remaining Time was spent in soliciting for me.</p>
            <p>At length a Hearing came on; and, after a short Trial honest <hi>Fairface</hi> was cast in Principal and double Costs. He was instantly taken into Custody, and put un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der Confinement, till he discharged the whole Amount of the Judgment in my Favour.</p>
            <p>No sooner was one Suit over, wherein I was Plaintiff, but Another was commenced wherein I happened to prove but a very weak Defendant. The Marquis now be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>came Solicitor for himself, but with such a sweet Timidity as seemed to doubt, and greatly dread the Success of his Cause.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="289" rend="none"/>
I could not refuse my Time to him who had devoted the Whole of his Time and Assiduity to me. We spent whole Days together. But O, what Floods of Tears did that Time (at Times) cost both him and me, while he pathetically and feelingly related your History, from the Place where you broke off, to the Death of your <hi>Louisa</hi> and your precious Infants.</p>
            <p>I believe, my Cousin, that, as Grief is a greater Softener, so it is a greater Ce<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>menter of Hearts than any other Passion. I gave the Marquis, in my Turn, my lit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle Story, and dwelt on every tender Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nuteness of my infant Passion for you. Ah, said he, what a pity that a Heart, so sus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceptible of all divine and humane Feel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings, should sit as a lonely Turtle, upon the House-top, without a suitable Mate.</p>
            <p>I took him for that Mate, my Cousin, and in a Husband I found the truest and tenderest of Lovers. I became pregnant, for the first Time of my Life, and was de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>livered of a sweet and promising little Fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low, whom we left at Nurse in our Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try Seat, while I attended my Lord on his Embassy to <hi>Morocco:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, here I must stop, my Brother, I am under the positive Interdiction of an
<pb n="289" facs="290" rend="none"/>imperial Thing called a Husband, not to divulge a Word further till he sees you Face to Face. But I trust that he has blessed Tidings for you, my Brother, he says that he, otherwise, would not have dared to present himself before you, after his Loss of your <hi>Eloisa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> smiled (careless) as at the Impossibility of any consoling Event upon Earth. Again, smiling archly, I protest, my Sister, said he, you appear to me to grow younger for your Years. I see no Manner of Alteration, save that you are something plumper, and not quite so slen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der as when we parted. O, says she, laughing, there may be a Reason in Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture for that.</p>
            <p>I rejoice at Heart to hear it, said Mr. <hi>Clinton;</hi> but pray, when may we expect my Brother? — In about two Months; at present he is engaged with the King, who is extremely fond of him, and lately created him a Duke, on account of the Services which he rendered the State in <hi>Africa.</hi> We received your dear Letter, my dearest Brother, at <hi>Paris,</hi> but wonder<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed who the sweet Fellow could be who was said to accompany you.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, our Hero and the young Prince were in close Combination.
<pb n="290" facs="291" rend="none"/>
               <hi>Abenamin</hi> stepped about, and about <hi>Harry,</hi> and toyed with him, and twisted the Curls of his careless Locks around his Fingers. Then turning and looking fondly up in his Face, Ah, how fair, says he, does this black Visage of mine shew in those fine Eyes of yours! It is in Truth, said <hi>Harry,</hi> so fair in my Eyes, that I would not ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>change it for fifteen of the fairest female Faces in <hi>Britain.</hi> The Prince then caught his Hand and pressed it to his Bosom. But what shall I call you, says he, you are a great Lord in this Country, and, in my own Country I am greater than a Lord. But I hate the Formality of Titles between Friends, and I will call you my <hi>Harry,</hi> provided you promise to call me your <hi>Abe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>namin.</hi> A Bargain, says <hi>Harry,</hi> let us seal it with a Kiss! No, no, says the Prince, we never kiss Lips in <hi>Africa,</hi> but I will kiss your Head, and your Hands, and your Feet too with Pleasure. But tell me, <hi>Harry,</hi> what makes you so mighty clever a Fellow, will you teach me to be a clever Fellow also? Ay, that I will, says <hi>Harry,</hi> and to beat myself too, provided you pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mise not to hit me over hard. <hi>Abenamin</hi> fell a laughing, and aimed a little Fist as though he meant to overturn him.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Harry</hi>'s Grief, for his late <hi>Maria,</hi> would allow him to associate, he
<pb n="291" facs="292" rend="none"/>had been to seek his old Friend and Tutor Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> but he found only a single Domestic at home, who told him that the old Gentleman had been some Time dead, and that the Family were lately gone to take Possession of a new Seat that they had purchased in the Country.</p>
            <p>However, as <hi>Harry</hi> found himself quite happy in the present Society, he sought no further Acquaintance or Amusement in <hi>London.</hi> In less than three Weeks, the Retinue of the Prince and the Dutchess were well restored, and they All set out for <hi>Enfield,</hi> there to await the wished Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rival of the Duke.</p>
            <p>They slept the first Night at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and toward the Noon of the third Day they set up at the Angel Inn in <hi>Coventry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It happened to be a Season of Festivity in the Town. Over against the front Windows, a Stage had been erected for a Mountebank and his Merry Andrew; and, as soon as they had dismounted, it became a Stage for Combatants. Two Quarterstaffs and a Pair of Basket-hilted Cudgels lay thereon; while an adjoining Pole was hung with a Variety of Prizes de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stined to the Conquerors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="293" rend="none"/>
Immediatley two Champions mounted, with two Seconds appointed to see fair Play. But One of the Combatants was quickly dismissed with a broken Head. Another then succeeded, and then Another, to the Amount of half a Score, but the first Hero still kept the Field of Battle. While <hi>Harry</hi> sat, with his Company, looking out of the Dining-Room Windows at the Di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>version.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Jack</hi> came behind his Lord, and giving him a Touch on the Shoulder, whisperingly begged his Permission to claim the Stage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> assented. <hi>Jack</hi> was up in a Twink<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ling, and quickly dispatched the Victor, as he had served his Predecessors. A Number of Candidates then succeeded, but with no better Fortune; and the Prize was taking down to be deliver'd to our Friend <hi>Jack;</hi> when an elderly looking Man desired to be lifted on the Stage.</p>
            <p>Come, says he to <hi>Jack,</hi> you seem to be a clever Fellow, let us quit this Boy's Play, and take up the Quarterstaff; when <hi>Jack,</hi> remembering a Piece of an old Ballad, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peated, <hi>accurss'd be he, Earl</hi> Piercy <hi>said, by whom it is deny'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="294" rend="none"/>
They grasped their formidable Wea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pons, and Each threw himself into an ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pert Posture of Defence. Then began the Work to grow warm, and these Champi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons had twice traversed the whole Round of the Stage, before a Wound or Bruise was received on either Part.</p>
            <p>At the third Bout, the old Stager made a Feint at his Adversary's left Leg, and, in attempting to defend it, the Sconce of our Friend <hi>Jack</hi> was cover'd with Blood, and he sprung off the Stage and instantly vanished.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then stepped backward and or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dered his Servant to be called, and, laugh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, cried, Ah my poor <hi>Jack!</hi> I knew what would be your Fate the Moment I saw the Face of your Opponent. You unfortunatley met with the famous <hi>Oakum,</hi> the old Prizer of <hi>Islington;</hi> many and many a Lesson have I got from him. But, you may happen to get some Satisfaction ere long. Run, and give yonder Fool a Crown, for the Loan of his patched Coat for a few Minutes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jack</hi> flew on his Embassy, while <hi>Harry</hi> burned a Stick at a back Room Fire, with which he made to himself very formidable Eyebrows and Whiskers. Then, hurry<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
<pb n="294" facs="295" rend="none"/>on the Fool's Coat, he stepped forth and desired to be lifted on the Stage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oakum</hi> little expected a second Adversa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry, but, when he saw the Merry-Andrew, as he supposed, he had like to be suffocated by a sudden Fit of Laughter, while the Crowd tore the Elements to Fritters with their Clamour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then put himself in an aukward and peasant-like Posture, while <hi>Oakum,</hi> ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vancing carelesly, made a slight but, as he thought, demolishing Stroke at him. But <hi>Harry,</hi> setting it aside with the one End of his Staff, gave <hi>Oakum,</hi> with the other End, as it were a chance Chuck under the Chin, and tossed him on the broad of his Back along the Stage.</p>
            <p>The Shouts of the Populace were then redoubled. At length <hi>Oakum,</hi> arising, fixed his Eyes upon <hi>Harry</hi> with an inquisitive Astonishment, as desirous of knowing how this Business came about. While <hi>Harry,</hi> with a Grin of stupid Amazement, seemed equally to wonder at what he had done.</p>
            <p>Again they set themselves in hostile Op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position. <hi>Oakum</hi> then aimed a disabling Stroke at <hi>Harry's</hi> right Shin; but <hi>Harry,</hi> quick as Thought, slipping his Leg back<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward,
<pb n="295" facs="296" rend="none"/>gave the Weapon Room to pass, and, at the same Time, bestowing a sud<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den Tip on the Crown of his old Master, he cut him along the Skull, and gave him once more to measure his Length upon the Boards.</p>
            <p>The Crowd stood awhile silent, as scarce crediting what had passed before their Eyes, till <hi>Oakum,</hi> rising and staggering, and again fastening his Sight upon our Hero, cried aloud, either You must be the DEVIL or young HARRY FENTON.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then stepped up, and put his Mouth to the Ear of his Adversary. <hi>Oakum,</hi> says he, here are five Guineas to help toward the Cure of your broken Head. But remember that it is not honourable for the Masters of our Science to set them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves in Competition against the Ignorant. <hi>Oakum</hi> bowed and withdrew; crying, Hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven be praised that it is no Other than my own Scholar who foils me.</p>
            <p>The Clamours of the Populace now be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>came outrageous. The Prize of a silver'd Coronet interwoven with Laurel, was pluck<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed down in a hurry and placed on the Head of our Hero. All the Towns-people then put their Hands in their Pockets, and, mustering their Shillings and Sixpences, threw them in Showers on the Stage;
<pb n="296" facs="297" rend="none"/>while the Dutchess, Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and the generous <hi>Abenamin</hi> also emptied their Poc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kets, to reward the Prowess of the Man who had vindicated the Quarrel of their favourite <hi>Jack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Profusion of Money was faith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fully gathered up, by the two Seconds, and delivered in a Hat full of Silver to <hi>Harry,</hi> who, bestowing a Handful on Each, delivered the Remainder to his Man <hi>Jack</hi> who stood by the Stage.</p>
            <p>The Crowd then ascended, and, laying violent Hands on our Hero, bore him tri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>umphantly away. They then placed him in an Arm-Chair erected on long Poles, and, hoising his Carriage on their Shoul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders, they carried him in the Midst of Peals of Shouts up the Street, while an ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointed Herald went before them and cried, O the FOOL, the FOOL, the brave, the no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble FOOL, who beats the Skill of the Wise, and the Acts of the Mighty to Pieces! At length, <hi>Harry,</hi> growing tired of this Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rade, put his Hand on the Head of one of his Carriers, vaulted lightly over, instantly vanished from their Sight, and flew up Stairs to his Company.</p>
            <p>His Friends now began to recognize their <hi>Harry,</hi> in the Coat of the Fool, and
<pb n="297" facs="298" rend="none"/>broke into repeated Fits of Laughter. <hi>Abenamin</hi> then turned to his beloved Friend and cried, what's become of my handsome <hi>Harry?</hi> why, he is turned to almost as ug<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly a Fellow as myself. Then, kissing his Forehead and stroaking his Cheeks, he said, O, It was the cleverest and darlingest FOOL that ever I knew in the livelong Days that I have passed upon Earth.</p>
            <p>When the Populace perceived their fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vourite Fool seated in the Midst of Quality, they All gathered to the Inn, and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>menced their Shouts anew. But <hi>Harry,</hi> calling for his Hat of Silver, as also for all the Change that could be mustered in the House, amounting to the Value of about thirty Guineas, he threw his Cash in Hand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fulls on every Side, till he was nearly ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hausted, and that the Crowd cried out, Enough, enough, your Honour, too much, too much indeed▪ O, that All would equally learn to set Bounds to their Avarice!</p>
            <p>When Dinner was over, and that <hi>Harry</hi> was restored to his former Self, our Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pany, again, set out on their Journey, amidst the Blessings and Acclamations of the whole City, who had ranged themselves on, each Side, to behold and pay them Obei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sance as they pass'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="299" rend="none"/>
The next Day, as they stopped at a Village to repair the fractured Harness of an over mettled Horse; <hi>Harry,</hi> mean while, took a walk with his <hi>Abenamin</hi> along the Road. In their Way they came to a long and waste Cottage, where they heared the confused clattering of junior Voices. <hi>Harry</hi> stepped to the Door, and, looking in, perceived about forty or fifty Boys rang<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed on Benches of Turf, while a Man of a pale Aspect sat on a decayed Chair, instruct<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing them in their Lessons.</p>
            <p>Your Servant, Sir, says <hi>Harry,</hi> pray what Language do you teach? — I can teach <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> too, so please your Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour, but the People of this Country choose to confine themselves to the Language of old <hi>England.</hi>—If I am not too free, Sir, pray what is your Name?—<hi>Longfield,</hi> so please your Honour.—<hi>Longfield, Longfield?</hi> I have surely heared that Name before. Pray, were you ever acquainted with a Man called <hi>Hammel Clement? — Hammel Clement,</hi> Sir? he was my dearest Friend, the Friend whom I injured, the Friend of my Heart! — Then, cries <hi>Harry,</hi> you are the Friend of my Heart too, my <hi>Longfield,</hi> and so saying, he em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>braced and pressed him to his Bosom.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="299-348" type="pages">
            <pb n="299" facs="300" rend="none"/>
            <p>The poor Man shrunk back, in half Wonder and half Terror at what this might mean, but the benevolent <hi>Harry</hi> soon quieted his Apprehensions. Your Friend <hi>Clement,</hi> says-he, is come to great Fortune, and, I dare answer for him, would be nearly distracted with Joy at your Sight, and would gladly divide his Substance with you; but, if you please, you shall be no Incumbrance upon his growing Family. You shall instantly come with me, and, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said to <hi>Jacob,</hi> regard not your Stuff, for the Good of all my Lands lies before You, my <hi>Longfield.</hi> And I rejoice more in acquiring such a Heart as Yours, than if I had acquired the Possession of a Province.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then called a few of the Neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bours in, and giving them some Guineas, to be changed and divided among the Chil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dren, in order to enable them to see a new Master, He and <hi>Abenamin</hi> took the thread<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bare <hi>Longfield,</hi> on each Side, under the Arm, and carried him away.</p>
            <p>When they came to the Turn that led to the Mansion House, <hi>Harry</hi> perceived with much Pleasure, that the two School-Houses, which he had put in Hand before the Death of his Father, were now com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pleated. They stood opposite to each
<pb n="300" facs="301" rend="none"/>other, with the Road between them. Their Fronts were of hewn Stone; and a small Cupola rose over Each, with Bells to summon the Children to Meals and to Lesson.</p>
            <p>Here, <hi>Longfield,</hi> says our Hero, is to be your Province. You are to superintend these Schools, at a Salary of three hundred a Year. And I will soon send you, with proper Means, throughout the Country, to muster me a Hundred chosen Children of each Sex, for I yearn to be a Father, <hi>Longfield,</hi> and to gather my Family of Lit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle Ones under my Eye and my Wing.</p>
            <p>As soon as they alighted, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and his <hi>Harry</hi> once more welcomed the Dutchess and her <hi>Abenamin</hi> to their Home and their Hearts, and the late House of Mourning became a House of Joy.</p>
            <p>Above All, <hi>Abenamin</hi> inspired Mirth and Good humour throughout the Family; and Melancholy fled before him wherever he turned. He was daily inventive of new Matters of Entertainment. He danced <hi>African</hi> Dances, for them, with wonderful Action and Grace; and he sung <hi>African</hi> Songs that imitated and exceeded the wild and inarticulate Warblings of the Nightin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gale. So that he became the Darling and little Idol of the whole Houshold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="302" rend="none"/>
               <hi>Harry</hi> had sent for the Town Taylor, and got <hi>Longfield</hi> fitted with three or four Suits from his Father's Wardrobe. He then sent him on his Commission, in Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pany with Mr. <hi>Trustly</hi> the Agent, whom he ordered to shew him the Country, to intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duce him to the several Families of the Peasantry, and to furnish him with what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever Sums he should call for.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, our Hero and <hi>Abe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>namin</hi> became inseparable. He made the Prince a Present of his little dressed Jennet, and at Times rode out with him, and taught him the Manage. At other Times they would run and wrestle, and play a hundred Gambols through the Walks and the Gardens.</p>
            <p>Did you ever see the Chase of the Ante<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lope, <hi>Harry?</hi>—Not I truely.—You shan't be long so, says the Prince. Go, gather me all the House, Man, Woman, and Child before the Door here. You shall be the Huntsman, and I will be the Antelope, and if any of your People can catch me, in a Mile's Running, they shall have my Cap for a Kerchief.</p>
            <p>Immediately the whole Posse was sum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>moned, to the amount of about sixty Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons,
<pb n="302" facs="303" rend="none"/>Male and Female; and Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and the Dutchess, hearing what they were about, came laughing to the Door to see the Diversion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then gave his royal Antelope about fifty Yards Law, then cried, away! and instantly all Heels and all Voices were loosed after him.</p>
            <p>The Prince then turned, and bounded over an Aha, that was sunk on the right Side of the Avenue, then, clearing several other Obstacles, whereby he threw out the greatest Number of his Pursuers, he at length reached the Fields, and shot away like an Arrow.</p>
            <p>Our Friend <hi>Jack</hi> headed about nine fo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign and domestic Footmen, who still held the Chase, though at a Distance; while <hi>Abenamin</hi> led them a Round of above a Mile. Then, turning short homeward, he came flying up the Avenue, with only <hi>Jack</hi> and two Followers puffing far behind. At length, reaching near the Door, the Prince threw himself precipitately into the Arms of his Friend, as it were for Protec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, crying, Save me, my <hi>Harry,</hi> save, save your little Antelope!</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and the Dutchess, then, successively embraced the Victor, and wish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
<pb n="303" facs="304" rend="none"/>him Joy. I protest, <hi>Harry,</hi> cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I will bet a thousand Pieces with you, on the Head of my <hi>Abenamin</hi> against your famous <hi>Polly Truck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Night, as our Hero sat with the Prince in his Apartment, Have You ever been in Love, my <hi>Harry,</hi> says he? I con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fess, said <hi>Harry,</hi> that I have had my Twitches and Tendencies that Way.</p>
            <p>He then gave him a Narrative of the Struggles of his Heart, respecting the fair <hi>Aggy Jessamin.</hi> And again he related to him the Tragedy of his faithful <hi>Maria,</hi> which cost the Prince the drenching of a Handkerchief in Tears.</p>
            <p>Ah, exclaimed the Prince, never, never will I forgive your <hi>Maria</hi> her Death! Why was it not my Lot, by some severer Doom, to prove to you the Superiority of my Friendship and Affection? What, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> would you not leave me a single Companion upon Earth? when my <hi>Abena<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>min</hi> quits the World, I shall also bid it adieu!</p>
            <p>When Tears were wiped away, the Prince took his Friend by the Hand and said: I have a Sister, my Brother, a Sister twinned with me in the Womb, and as fair
<pb n="304" facs="305" rend="none"/>as I am black. All <hi>Africa</hi> is pleased to hail her as the Beauty of the Universe, but the Truth is, that I think but poorly of her. The Duke brought her with him to <hi>France,</hi> and, should he bring her to <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land,</hi> beware of your Heart, my <hi>Harry!</hi> for, though I am prejudiced against her, she is the Idol of all Others, who bow down to her, as before a little Divinity. This has made her so excessively vain, that she holds herself of a different Species from the rest of Mankind, and thinks the Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mage of the World nothing less than her Right. And now, my <hi>Harry,</hi> though I earnestly wish to be allied to you, by a Tie, nearer if possible than that of Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship, yet I would not wish my own Happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, at the Expence of your Peace; and so I give you timely Warning against this dangerous and haughty Girl.</p>
            <p>Our Company had now been upward of six Weeks at the Mansion House. <hi>Harry,</hi> hitherto, had never seen any Part of the Country, or any Part of his own Estate, above a Mile from the House. Where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, leaving his Friend <hi>Abenamin</hi> in Bed, in the Presumption of his being tired with his last Day's Fatigue, He issued early forth, accompanied only by <hi>Jack</hi> and his Agent's Runner, who knew and was known every where.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="306" rend="none"/>
With their Staffs in their Hands, they crossed and quartered the Country, at Pleasure, without Let or Obstacle.</p>
            <p>At length, they came within Prospect of a House sumptuously fronted, and of a happy Situation. <hi>Harry</hi> stopped here, with Pleasure, comparing, as he approach<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, the Acquirements of Art with the Advantages of Nature; when a Servant issued forth, and humbly besought him to walk in. <hi>Harry</hi> heard the Voice of Music. What is your Master's Name, says he? <hi>Fielding,</hi> so please your Honour, and we are this Day celebrating the Nuptials of his Son, the young Squire.</p>
            <p>The Master of the Family met our Hero at the outward Door. <hi>Harry</hi> recoiled at recognizing the Face of the Mr. <hi>Fielding,</hi> whom he had seen at <hi>Hamstead,</hi> but, taking no Notice, walked with him into the House.</p>
            <p>Breakfast, soon after, was ushered in, and Mrs. <hi>Fielding,</hi> and Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tharines,</hi> and <hi>Ned</hi> came with his bloom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing and blushing Bride to the Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> chuckled and rejoiced at Heart, but still took no Note; when, after some
<pb n="306" facs="307" rend="none"/>cursory Conversation, <hi>Ned</hi> looked at him with an eager Disturbance and cried, Bless me, my Heart tells me that there is some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing in that Face which is not quite un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>known to me. If I could think, after my many and late Enquiries, that my Patron was alive, bating the Difference of Years, I should verily believe that you were—your <hi>Harry Fenton,</hi> cried our Hero, spring<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing up, your <hi>Harry Fenton,</hi> my dear <hi>Ned!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then opened his Arms to receive his Friend, while <hi>Ned</hi> leaped and catched at him, as the grapling Iron of a Corsair would catch at a Ship from which great Prize was expected,</p>
            <p>All the Family then, so highly as they had been obliged by our Hero and his Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, struggled who should be foremost in their Acknowledgments and Caresses. The holy <hi>Catharines,</hi> fondly taking him to his Arms cried, Christ be gracious to you, my Child! and may the God, who has formed you as an Angel upon Earth, make you also of the highest Order of Angels in Heaven!</p>
            <p>After Dinner, <hi>Harry</hi> rose and took his Leave, but they all got in a Group and op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed his Passage, telling him he must be their Prisoner for that Night. I con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent, only on this Condition, said <hi>Harry,</hi>
               <pb n="307" facs="308" rend="none"/>that you promise to dine with me, All, To-morrow. Why pray Sir, where do you live, says Mr. <hi>Fielding?</hi> At <hi>Enfield,</hi> with the young Earl of <hi>Moreland,</hi> says <hi>Harry,</hi> but he has a great Friendship for me, and the House is as it were my own.</p>
            <p>Much Company arrived in the Evening, and the Ball was opened and held till late. But our Hero declined dancing, that his Friend <hi>Ned</hi> might stand forth peerless in the Eyes of his Bride.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> rose, by the Dawning, and footed it in an Hour to <hi>Enfield.</hi> He flew up Stairs to salute the Family, but found no One, save Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> from whom he re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived, at once, a warm Blessing and Em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brace.</p>
            <p>Where is the Dutchess, Sir, and my Friend <hi>Abenamin?</hi> Gone, <hi>Harry,</hi> says his Uncle, about Breakfast Time Yesterday; a Courier arrived with the joyful Tidings that my Brother was on the Road, and so my Sister and our <hi>Abenamin</hi> hastened to meet him. By this Time I suppose they are All on their Return. And now take Care of yourself, my <hi>Harry.</hi> The Duke brings with him the Sister of our <hi>Abenamin,</hi> the fair Princess <hi>Abenaidè;</hi> the Dutchess tells me that a lovelier Creature never be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>held
<pb n="308" facs="309" rend="none"/>the Light; so that you must guard your Heart with double Bars, against the Power of this Beauty.—She is vain and disdainful, Sir, excessively vain, I am told, so that her Pride will prove an Antidote against the Poison of her Charms. How<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever I will haste to meet and welcome your most noble Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> was mounted on a haughty Char<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ger, that cost fifteen hundred Guineas when a Colt in <hi>Mauritania.</hi> He was white as new fallen Snow, save a black Mane and Tail, one Foot jet Black to the Joint of the Fetlock, and three large blood-like Spots on the far Shoulder. He was so perfectly in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>structed and subdued to the Manage, that he seemed to have no Will save the Will of his Rider, while <hi>Harry</hi>'s least Motion, like Electricity, informed every Joint and Member. O, that the Wills of all Men were equally subdued to the Sceptre of the Prince of Righteousness, reigning and ruling within them!</p>
            <p>The Princess came foremost in an open Chariot drawn by six spotted Arabians. The Chariot was plated all around in bur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nished Gold emblazoned with Gems of Lustre. But, if the Eye could scarce bear the Blaze of the Vehicle, much less could it support the Brightness of the Beauty who sat enthroned within it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="310" rend="none"/>
               <hi>Harry</hi> bowed twice, as he approached, but she scare deigned a perceptible Nod of Acknowledgment to his Salute.—Our Hero felt himself piqued. Proud Beauty! thought he, I thank you for your timely Prevention of a Passion that, perhaps, might have proved unhappy to me. He then passed forward with affected Careles<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness to salute the Duke.</p>
            <p>When he came up, the Coach stopped, and <hi>Harry,</hi> flying from his Saddle, ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proached the Window, while his Steed stood trembling but motionless behind him.</p>
            <p>My Lord, said <hi>Harry,</hi> seizing the Duke's Hand and respectfully kissing it, if you were sensible of the Joy that my Heart receives from your Presence, I think it would make you nearly as happy as my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self. My sweet Fellow, said the Duke, I have often heard of you at <hi>Paris,</hi> as also by the Letters of my Love here; my Longing at last is gratified, though my Wonder is encreased.</p>
            <p>But Madam, says <hi>Harry,</hi> what have you done with my little Playfellow, what's become of my <hi>Abenamin?</hi> O, cried the Dutchess, laughing, he is forthcoming I
<pb n="310" facs="311" rend="none"/>warrant you; but what has so bewitched you to him? I think you could not be fon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der, if he were a Mistress. True, Madam, answered <hi>Harry,</hi> sighing, I never look to have a Mistress that I shall love half as well; but pray put me out of Pain, and let me know where he is. Be pacified, said the smiling Duke, he is not far off; and here is my Hand and Promise that you shall see him before Night.</p>
            <p>Our Hero then turned, and touching his left Hand to the Shoulder of his Horse, he rose perpendicular, like a Pyramid of Fire, and again descended on his Seat, as a Flake of Snow on a Rose-Bud. He then touched his white Wand to the Neck of his Steed, who instantly mounted the Air, like a winged <hi>Pegasus,</hi> while the Dutchess shout<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed out, thinking her <hi>Harry</hi> a gone Man, but he returned as composed, as though he were seated on a Bed of Cotton.</p>
            <p>The Coach now began to move, and <hi>Harry</hi> put his Wand to the Flank of his Horse, who, turning his Head to the Car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riage, as of his own Accord, moved side<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>long toward <hi>Enfield,</hi> with a proud but gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle Prancing; while the Duke cried out, Look, look! O the Boy, O the Boy, the lovely glorious Boy!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="312" rend="none"/>
As our Hero attended the Carriage of the Duke, the Princess and her Train had got to the House and alighted, while <hi>Harry</hi> opened the Coach Door, and handed out the noble Pair, who alternately kissed and took him to their Arms. Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> then came forth and received them All with Transport. But <hi>Harry,</hi> under some Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tence, walked away, ruminating, in order to avoid the disdainful Regards of the young Lady.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, our Company, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>joicing, and caressing Each other all the Way, had got slowly, though very loving<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, to the great Mansion Parlour. The Duke then, respectfully taking the young Lady by the Hand, Permit me, Brother, says he, to recommend to you my lovely Ward, the fair Princess of <hi>Morocco.</hi> The Lady then gently bent one Knee toward the Ground, while she received the cordial Blessing and Salute of the old Gentleman.</p>
            <p>They then took their Seats. When, Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> while he looked more earnest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly on the Princess, grew suddenly affected, and called out for a Glass of fair Water and Hartshorn. When he drank it, be found himself in a Measure restored, and, lifting his Hands, he cried, I protest One would think that Nature had copied this
<pb n="312" facs="313" rend="none"/>young and lovely Creature from an Image that has lain impressed upon my Heart, near these forty Years.</p>
            <p>You are in the right, my Brother, ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>claimed the Duke, it is even as you surmize. Allow me then, once more, to introduce to you the Counterpart of our once adora<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble <hi>Louisa,</hi> to introduce to you my Niece and your own Offspring, my Brother, even the Daughter of your still living and ever precious <hi>Eloisa.</hi> The Princess then sprung forward, and, dropping precipitately at the Feet of her Grandfather, she put her Face between his Knees, and, seizing both Hands, she bathed them with her Tears, crying, My Father, O my Father, my dear, my dearest Father, how inexpressi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bly blessed I think myself, to be the Off<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spring of such a Father! Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> then raising her, and seating her fondly on his Knee, and grasping her to his Bosom, I will not ask, he cried, how these Miracles came about, it is enough that I feel the Attraction which pulls you into my Heart. And so saying, their Tears flowed, till they mingled on the Flooring.</p>
            <p>Go, my Angel, said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and take yonder Seat, that I may view and delight my Soul with your Sight, at Lei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure. My Eyes begin, at these Years, to see best at a Distance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="314" rend="none"/>
At length, the soft Voice of our <hi>Harry</hi> was heard in the Hall, and the Duke, whispering his Brother, requested him, for a little Time, to take no Notice of what had passed.</p>
            <p>Our Hero then entered, bowing respect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fully and gracefully, but carelesly toward the Side where the Princess sat. He then took his Seat beside the Duke, and bend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing fondly to him, and seizing a Hand, with both his Hands, he pressed it to his Lips and cried, Welcome, welcome, my dearest Lord, to the House and the Hearts of your truest Lovers!</p>
            <p>Then, giving a Glance to the Side where the Princess sat, he caught a Glimpse of her Attractions and, sighing, said to him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, O, the Pity, the Pity! But, no Mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter; her Pride shall never suffer a single Charm to take Place; and, so thinking, he turned his Eyes aside.</p>
            <p>Mean time, <hi>Abenaidè</hi> arose, with as lit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle Noise as a Hare from her Seat; and stealing round, like a Cat circumventing a Mouse, She came behind <hi>Harry</hi>'s Chair, and reaching, and covering an Eye, with each of her Hands, she turned his Head to her, and made a Sound with her Lips,
<pb n="314" facs="315" rend="none"/>as though she had kissed him. <hi>Harry</hi> opened his Eyes in utter Astonishment, while in a Twinkling standing before him, she chuckled a Laugh and cried, Ha, ha, he, — my <hi>Harry,</hi> what, have you for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>got me, don't you remember your old Playfellow, your little Friend <hi>Abenamin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi>'s Eyes were now opened, in the Midst of the Hurry and Agitation of his Soul. At a Glimpse he took in the whole Oppression of her Beauties; and, casting himself, quick as a Glance of Lightning, at her Feet, he seized the Hem of her Robe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing and glued it to his Mouth.</p>
            <p>At length, lifting up his Eyes, he cried, Ah, what are all these Wonders to me, or my Happiness, unless my <hi>Abenamin</hi> will also become my <hi>Abenaidè?</hi> That, replied the Princess, is not at my Option, there sits my Lord and Father at whose Disposal I am.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then rose, and, throwing himself at the Feet of his revered Patron, embraced his Legs in Silence, while Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> cried out, Yes, my <hi>Harry,</hi> I understand you; nothing shall ever be wanting to the Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness of my Darling, that the Power of his tender Parent and loving Uncle can effect. I can have nothing in Heaven or Earth,
<pb n="315" facs="316" rend="none"/>that is not the Property of my <hi>Harry. Harry</hi> kissed his Feet and sprung up.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> then continued, I aver, I am still in a Labyrinth. Did you not say, my <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> that you were also our <hi>Abena<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>min?</hi> I did, my Lord, says she, but I did not dare to avow myself. Ah what a pain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful Struggle did that Restriction cost me! while I panted to catch and to cling to your honoured Feet; while I used to look, and gaze upon you, unperceived; while my Heart swelled with Affection, and my Eyes with restrained Tears, and while I kissed, in secret, the Book that you read, and the Ground that you trod on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abenaidè</hi> then sat down, and <hi>Harry,</hi> lightly throwing himself on the Ground beside her, looked beseechingly around and cried, My Lord, my dearest Lady, our still precious <hi>Fanny Goodall,</hi> can you vouch, can ye warrant that I am safe in this Mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter? Then, looking up to the Princess, and drinking her in; No, he cried, you can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not engage it, I feel that I shall perish in the very Ecstasy of the Expectation of being united to her.</p>
            <p>Just then, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> came in. He had been long and far away, upon many a blessed Tour of doing good through the
<pb n="316" facs="317" rend="none"/>Earth. But, as soon as he heared of the Arrival of his beloved Patron and young Lord, he rode post to embrace them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> sprung from Love to Friendship, and catching him in his Arms, cried, O, my <hi>Meekly,</hi> my dearest <hi>Meekly,</hi> how season<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ably you come, to temper, by your Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice, the insufferable Transports of my Soul; behold the Regent of my Heart, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hold the Queen of all my Wishes!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meekly</hi> then fixed his Eyes upon the Princess, and soon after exclaimed; Graci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous Father! what do I see? Can <hi>the Louisa</hi> be resuscitated and new raised from the Dead? O then, it must be so, she must be her Descendent. No One, save my peerless Patroness, could produce the Likeness of my Patroness. But how this blessing Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racle was brought about is the Question.</p>
            <p>That is my Question too, my dear <hi>Meek<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly,</hi> said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> if my most noble Bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther would be so good as to solve it. I will gratify you, Gentlemen, said the Duke, in as few Words as possible. Mean while, the Princess withdrew.</p>
            <p>On my Embassy to the Court of <hi>Morocco,</hi> I had several private Interviews with the Emperor, before my Credentials were open<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed in Public. I had the good Fortune to
<pb n="317" facs="318" rend="none"/>be liked by him, so that he suffer'd no Day to pass without seeing me. His Name was <hi>Abenamin,</hi> he was accounted a great Captain, he exceeded All in his Dominions for Grace of Person and Beauty of Aspect; and that which render'd him still more sin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gular was, that he had given Liberty to all the Ladies of his Seraglio, and, for ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny Years, had kept constant to the reign<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Sultana, said to be the most exquisite Beauty upon Earth.</p>
            <p>As we grew more intimate, in the Exu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berance of his Affection for his Empress, he could not refrain from speaking of her to me, and he promised that, before I de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parted, I should see and converse with her; a Grace, he said, never granted to any other Man.</p>
            <p>At length, the Day being appointed for my public Entry, I rode through the City, attended by a sumptuous Train, and alight<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing before the Palace, advanced to the Hall of Audience.</p>
            <p>The Emperor was seated, with his Sul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tana at his right Hand, upon a Throne of Ivory. As soon as I had approached the Presence, and began to open my Commis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion, the Empress gave a great Shriek, and fell over in a Swoon upon the Bosom of her Husband.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="319" rend="none"/>
The royal <hi>Abenamin</hi> instantly turned pale as Death, tore off her Veil with trem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bling Hands to give her Air, and called me to his Assistance, as it is accounted Profa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nation for any Moor to touch the Person of the Empress. But, O Heaven, O my Friend! think what was my Astonishment when, in the pale Face of the Queen, I beheld the loved Features of our darling <hi>Eloisa!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court broke up in Confusion, and her Women came hurrying with Drops and Essences. As soon as she recover'd, she opened her Eyes upon me, and reach<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing out her Arms, and catching me to her, she cried. O my Uncle, my dearest Uncle, am I so bless'd then as to behold you before I expire.</p>
            <p>The Monarch, in the mean Time, looked upon me with a jealous Eye, and twice put his Hand to the Haft of his Dag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ger, but checked his rising Indignation, till he should have the Mystery of his Queen's Behaviour explained. The Women then raised her up and bore her to her Apart<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment; while the Emperor, turning to me, with no very friendly Aspect, ordered me to follow him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="320" rend="none"/>
When I had attended a considerable Time in the Antichamber, He came forth with a serene and joyous Countenance, and em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bracing me, cried, O my Friend, my dear Kinsman, how transported I am to find and acknowledge You for such; the Parent of my Angel becomes a Part of myself.</p>
            <p>He then led me by the Hand into the Bedchamber of my <hi>Eloisa,</hi> where we re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>newed our Caresses without Restraint. But the Monarch, fearing that these Emotions would be too much for her, told me that he had something for my private Ear till Dinner; and took me into an adjoining Closet.</p>
            <p>There, seating, and taking me affecti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>onately by the Hand, I will now tell you, my Uncle, says he, how I came by this inestimable Treasure of your Niece.</p>
            <p>I had fitted out a royal Ship of my own, not as a Corsair, but rather for Trade in the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> On their Return from the Coast of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as they past, after a violent Hurricane, within Sight of old <hi>Car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thage,</hi> my People perceived, at a Distance, a Sloop stranded on a Shoal of Sand about a League from the Shore. Immediately they sent out a Boat and took the distressed
<pb n="320" facs="321" rend="none"/>Company in, consisting of my Charmer, two female Companions, and three Servants in Livery, beside the Boatmen.</p>
            <p>The Intendants of my Ship behaved themselves with all possible Respect toward the young Lady and her Attendants, and endeavoured to quiet her Terrors, by assuring her that she was free, and that their Prince was a Person of too much Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour and Humanity to derive any Advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tage from the Disasters of the Unfortu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nate.</p>
            <p>The Moment that they brought her be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore me, pale, trembling and in Tears; while she dropt on her Knees, and lifted to me her fine Eyes in a petitioning Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner; the Gates of my Soul opened to the sweetly affecting Image, and ever after closed, of their own accord, upon it.</p>
            <p>Ah, I cried, heavenly Creature, calm, calm your causeless Fears! I swear by our Prophet and the God of our Prophet, that I would rather suffer the Gaunch, than put the smallest Constraint on your Person or Inclinations. You are free, Madam, you shall ever be free, save so far as I may bind you by my tender Offices and Affections.</p>
            <p>I raised her, and she grew something better assured; when, bending a Knee in
<pb n="321" facs="322" rend="none"/>my Turn, I kissed her Robe and cried, Look not upon me as your Tyrant, look not on me as your Lover; but look upon me as your Friend, the tenderest and truest of Friends, who shall ever be ready to sacrifice his own Happiness to Your's.</p>
            <p>From that Time I studied every Amuse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, every Diversion, that might serve to dissipate the timid Shrinkings of her re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>maining Apprehensions. While I con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ducted myself toward her, with a distant though fond Respect, not even presuming to touch her ivory Hand.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, my Soul sicken'd, and grew cold to all other Women. If you were ever in Love, my dear <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> you know that it is a chaste as well as a tender Passion. I languished indeed for her, I longed and languish'd to Death; but then it was rather for her Heart than her Person that I languished.</p>
            <p>One Day, as she heaved a heavy but half suppress'd Sigh, Ah my Angel, I cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, I can have no Joy but Your's, and yet You have Griefs to which you keep your Friend, your <hi>Abenamin</hi> a Stranger. True, my Lord, says she, Tears breaking from her, all your Bounties have not been able to silence the Calls of Kindred or Claims of Nature within me. Ah, my Parents, my
<pb n="322" facs="323" rend="none"/>dear Parents; I feel more for You, than I feel even for myself, in being torn from you.</p>
            <p>The Weight of her Affliction fell, like a Mountain, on my Soul and crushed me to her Feet. You would leave me then, <hi>Eloisa,</hi> you wish to leave me, but your Ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerosity delays to tell me so, for fear of breaking my Heart.—Well, be it so—go from me—you know I cannot survive you—but, my Death is of no Consequence, my <hi>Eloisa</hi> shall be happy.—I will go this Instant, I will dispatch my swiftest Galley to <hi>Languedoc</hi>—I will write Word to your Parents that you are safe, that you are beloved, and yet pure and un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>touched, since respected as a Deity.—I will invite them to come and take Posses<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of my Treasures, my Dominions, my Heart: But—should they reject my Suit, I again swear, by <hi>Alla,</hi> to send You to them, laden with Wealth, though I my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self should drop dead at the Instant of your Departure.</p>
            <p>The noble Soul of my <hi>Eloisa</hi> became in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly affected. She caught a Hand be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween both of hers, and bathing it with Tears, cried, O, now indeed you have bound me by Chains infinitely stronger than all the Shackles that fasten the Slaves to the Gallies of <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="323" facs="324" rend="none"/>
I kept firm to my Engagement, and, in a few Weeks, my winged Messengers re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turned. But, O the Tidings, the very doleful Tidings for my Beloved! They brought Word that they found no Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture; save two ancient Domestics in the great Hotel, as two Ravens in the Midst of a lonely Forest.</p>
            <p>From these they learned, that my <hi>Eloisa</hi>'s Mother and little Brother were dead, that her Grandmother was dead, her Aunt the Marchioness also dead, and that the Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quis had retired they knew not whither.</p>
            <p>She wept incessantly, and I wept with her.—At length she softly said; You have conquer'd, my Lord, you have con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quer'd; I am subdued by your Weight of Affection! O, that You could but conform to one Article more, that we might be united as one Heart, and one Soul, and one Sentiment for ever!</p>
            <p>It was now, for the first Time, that I dared to seize her Hand, I crushed it to my Lips, and thrust it into my Soul. What would you enjoin, I cried, I would do any Thing, dare any Thing to be united to my <hi>Eloisa!</hi> in Life and in Death, Body to Body and Dust to Dust, never never to be sun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dered,
<pb n="324" facs="325" rend="none"/>till her Spirit should make the Hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven of my Spirit hereafter.</p>
            <p>Ah, she suddenly exclaimed, that, that is the very Thing I so eagerly desire. Let the God of my Heart be the God of your Heart, let the God of my Spirit be the God of your Spirit, so shall we be united in him, and jointly partake of his Blessed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness through Eternity!</p>
            <p>Ah, I cried, can I forego the divine Precepts of our Prophet? Your Prophet, says she, preaches only to the Eye and the Ear, and this is all that he does or can pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tend to: But <hi>Christ,</hi> my Prophet, preaches, in the Heart, to the Affections. From him is every good Motion divine or hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man, He is the unknown God of your Spirit, my Master, my <hi>Abenamin,</hi> and you feel his precious Power while you disavow his Name.</p>
            <p>I was puzzled, I was silenced. I bent a Knee in Reverence, kissed her Hand, and withdrew.</p>
            <p>I sent for the Chief of the Christian Mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sionaries, throughout the City and Country. I consulted Each of them in private, but received no Satisfaction from them. They All appeared equally zealous for my Refor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mation,
<pb n="325" facs="326" rend="none"/>but attempted it by different and even by opposite Arguments.</p>
            <p>Some would have persuaded me to be Christian, by shewing the Absurdity of every Religion that was not Christian. Others affirmed that my eternal Salvation depended on my Conformity to certain ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ternal Rules and Penances. While the greatest Number inveighed against the Christians of every other Denomination; and would have thrust me wholly from Christ, if I did not consent to receive him within their stinted Pale.</p>
            <p>I knew not what to do: I was put to a Stand, and quite confused by this Multi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plicity of conflicting Opinions. At length, a Countryman of my own came to me from the Desart. He had been a great Sinner, but was converted by the Sense of his Sins, and he was revered and resorted to by All the Friendless and Afflicted.</p>
            <p>I opened my Soul to him, with all its Doubts and Difficulties.—My Friend in CHRIST, said he, with a gentle and still Voice, they have been leading you all a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stray, quite away from the Haven that stretches forth its Arms for the Reception of long toiled Mariners, whom Storms have, at length, compelled to seek a final Port.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="327" rend="none"/>
The God of your Creation can alone be your Redemption, the God of your Nature can alone be the Salvation of the Nature that he imparted. But, who shall convince you of this? Not all the Angels in Heaven, nor all the Doctors upon Earth, till the Christ of your Heart shall be pleased to convince you that you are, as indeed you are (however mighty a Monarch) a poor, frail, erring, vile, and despicable Creature; subjected to innumerable Lapses and Infirmi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties, Sickness, Passions, and Crosses, Griefs, Agonies and Death. When this is effec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tually done, the Whole of the Business is done. You will call for and catch at a Sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>viour, in the Sensibility of your Want of him. When you come thus laden with your Sins to him, he will in no wise cast you out. But he will take you, as <hi>Noah</hi> took the wearied Dove into the Ark. He will take you within the Veil of his own Temple of Rest, and all Sects, Forms, and Ceremonies will be as the outward Courts, with which you shall have no Manner of Commerce or Concern.</p>
            <p>My Heart felt the Weight and the Ful<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of Conviction. I took him to my Arms and requested instant Baptism. My <hi>Eloisa</hi> was called, we locked ourselves in. And I was washed by Water and Faith in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to Christ, while my kneeling Angel wept a Stream of Delight beside me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="327" facs="328" rend="none"/>
It is said that Possession cloys. But I ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perienced, my dear <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> that Love never cloys. Every Day, with my <hi>Eloisa,</hi> seemed to triumph, in heart-felt Happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, over my first bridal Day. But O, what was the Joy, the Exultation of my fond Heart, when she gave me to be the Father of a little Daughter of Paradise!</p>
            <p>One Day, while we were toying and fool<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing with the smiling Infant, and throwing her, as she crowed, from the One to the Other. Ah, my Husband, cries <hi>Eloisa,</hi> how poor I was lately, no Parents, no Kindred, nothing but my <hi>Abenamin</hi> upon the whole Earth; and now God has been pleased to make my Affliction to laugh, and to give this Babe for a further Band, a precious Link of Love between us.</p>
            <p>He was just in this Part of his Narrati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on, when the Music sounded to the Ban<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quet. We instantly rose and joined our <hi>Eloisa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Collation was removed. Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dam, said I to the Empress, have you ever heard of a Relation, of yours, christened by the Name of <hi>Fanny Goodall,</hi> and lately Countess of <hi>Maitland?</hi> I have, said she, often heard my fond Father speak of her with filling Eyes. She is in this City, Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dam.
<pb n="328" facs="329" rend="none"/>She is no longer Countess of <hi>Mait<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land.</hi> She is now doubly your Relation, your Aunt as well as your Cousin, and goes by the Title of the Marchioness <hi>D'Aubigny.</hi> With the good Leave of my Lord here, I will bring her to you directly.</p>
            <p>I went to the Palace appointed for my Residence: I there gave my <hi>Fanny</hi> a few Heads of the Story of our <hi>Eloisa,</hi> and took her hastily to the Presence.</p>
            <p>The Ladies looked at Each other, in long and silent Admiration. Then, open<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing their Arms, and rushing together, they continued some Minutes locked in mutual Embraces.</p>
            <p>Madam, said the Emperor, smiling, I think I ought to be allowed the same Li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berties with my Aunt, that your Husband took with his Niece. Whereon, he wel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>comed and caressed her with an affectionate Fervour.</p>
            <p>O, exclaimed the royal Fair, how very poor, and how very rich our God can sud<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>denly make us! But then, Lord of my Life, to think of parting, of parting with these dear Friends again, perhaps never to see them more, that's what sinks and wrings my Heart, in the very Midst of Exultation!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="330" rend="none"/>
That, my Love, said the Emperor, is the very important Article on which I wish to consult with you and our Friends here, our dear Kindred in Christ. But I must first shew them their young Relation, my little Enchantress, my priceless Pearl, my Eye delighting <hi>Abenaide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then stept forth, and, after a while, led in a gracefully moving Creature, but veiled from the Head to the Waist. Throw up your Veil, my Love, says he; here are none but your Friends, your very dear Relations, your lovely Aunt and your Uncle, the Marquis and Marchioness <hi>D'Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bigny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She did as she was ordered, and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly broke upon my Sight, like a new Glory arisen upon Mid-day.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Fanny</hi> seized upon her, as desirous of devouring her. And I, in turn, took her to me, with tearfull Eyes, as almost persuaded that I embraced the newly re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vived Person of my dearest Sister <hi>Louisa;</hi> so perfect was the Resemblance in every Grace and Feature.</p>
            <p>When we had nearly oppressed the ce<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lestial looking Maid with our insatiate Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>resses;
<pb n="330" facs="331" rend="none"/>She seized our Hands and, kissing them, cried, What a blessed Day is this, that enriches <hi>Abenaidè</hi> with two Parents more; another precious Father, and ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther lovely Mother, happy, happy <hi>Abe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>naidè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her royal Father then gave a Beck, and she instantly vanished; while her Absence seemed to cast a Shade throughout the Room.</p>
            <p>The Monarch then, deeply musing and heavily sighing, began—I am now, my dearest Friends, Friends beloved above the World and all that it contains, I am now to open to you my inmost Heart, and to reveal a Purpose whereon I have been ruminating these many Months, but could not hit on an Expedient for bringing it to pass. How opportune has our <hi>Jesus</hi> sent you to us on this Occasion!</p>
            <p>I have but the two Children living; my <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> and a Son, by a former Woman of my Seraglio. His Name is <hi>Abencorrage;</hi> he is a Youth renowned in the Field, but of a proud and impetuous Demeanour. He had long conceived an illicit Passion for his young and lovely Sister. At length the Fire broke forth, and he lately at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tempted her Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="332" rend="none"/>
I would instantly have put him to death, had I any other Heir to succeed to my Do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minions. I therefore contented myself with banishing him my Court and my Presence, though I am sensible that this has not availed for the extinguishing his horrid Flame.</p>
            <p>Now, my Friends, should I die, or should this violent Boy break into Rebel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lion, for he is the Favourite of the licen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tious Soldiery, I tremble to think what would become of my bright eyed Dove, within the Talons of such a Vulture.</p>
            <p>This, together with my eager Desire of quitting a Kingdom of Infidels, and of join<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing with the blessed Society and Commu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion of Saints, has, after some Struggles, determined me to abdicate my Throne, as soon as I can amass and transmit a Fund sufficient for supporting my <hi>Eloisa</hi> and my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, with becoming Dignity, in her native Country.</p>
            <p>Ah, my Lord, I cried, clasping him pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sionately in my Arms, regard not your Treasures, delay not a Moment for that! your <hi>Eloisa</hi>'s Relations, both by Father and Mother, are possessed of princely Fortunes, and they will all be freely at the Disposal of your Majesty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="333" rend="none"/>
Ah, my <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> said he, I am not yet so duely mortified a Christian as need<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lesly to elect a State of Dependance, or willingly to descend at once from the King to the Beggar. I have however been pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>paring: I have already converted a large Part of my Effects into Bills and Jewels, of high Value but light Portage, to the a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mount, as I think, of about Sixty Million of <hi>French</hi> Money; this I will transmit by you, and as soon as I shall have com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>passed an equal Sum, I will stay no longer in <hi>Africa,</hi> I will fly to your Bosoms, my precious Friends.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, this violent and lust<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful Boy gives no Rest to my Apprehen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions. It is therefore necessary that I com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit my <hi>Abenaidè</hi> to your Trust. It is ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary, I say, that I tear away my choicest Limb, the dearest Part of my Vitals! Sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port me, Christ, in the Trial, but it must be gone through.</p>
            <p>This, however, must be done with all possible Privacy. I am persuaded that my young Villain has his Spies in and about my Palace. I shall therefore request my dear Aunt, to disguise my little Girl in Boy's Apparel, and to blacken every Part of her visible Complexion, that she may pass unnoticed, as your Page, through the
<pb n="333" facs="334" rend="none"/>Midst of my Attendants. As also that it may prove, during the Travels of my Darling, a Preservative against the Lust of the Eye, and any further Attempt tending to Violation.</p>
            <p>At length the Time approached and pressed for my Departure, but how to part was the Question. All Attendants were ordered to avoid the Presence, far away. Our metamorphosed <hi>Abenaidè</hi> stood weeping beside us, while her Father and Mother crushed us, successively, to their Bosoms. All was Passion, a Gush of Tears, but not a Word was uttered on any Part.</p>
            <p>O, my <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> cried the Emperor at length, Friend, Brother of my Heart, can you conceive what I feel at this Instant? I regard not the World, nor the Things of the World. Omit such necessary Accom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>modations as are common to us with Brutes; and All, belonging to the immortal and di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vine Humanity of Man, is Magnetism, is Fellowship, the Feeling, as of Steel to Adamant, and of Adamant to Steel. There is the Friendship, the Endearment, the Love, passing Love, and surpassing all other Enjoyment. If we meet again, my <hi>D'Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bigny,</hi> I shall anticipate my Heaven!</p>
            <p>Again, he embraced his little Angel, and again he embraced his Queen, and
<pb n="334" facs="335" rend="none"/>besought her to be comforted. We then took Leave, as for the last; and again they called us back, and embraced and took Leave again; till, seeing no End, I sudden<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly broke away, hurrying with us our <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> for fear of Observation. I for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>got, however, to tell You that, the Day before our Departure, the royal <hi>Abenamin</hi> had enjoined me to set apart twenty Mil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lion of Livres, for the Portion of his Child, in case she should be married to any great Prince or Potentate, requesting me, at the same Time, not to put any Constraint on the Inclinations of his Lamb.</p>
            <p>I have little further to say, my Brother. We arrived safe at <hi>Paris,</hi> where we receiv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed your Letter; and, impatient to make you happy, I dispatched my <hi>Fanny</hi> with her Train and your <hi>Abenaidè</hi> before me; enjoining them, however, not to reveal our Secret till my Arrival. For, as I had charged myself with the Loss of your <hi>Eloisa,</hi> I deemed myself best entitled to make you Reparation in Person. But, I ought not to omit that, before I left <hi>Paris,</hi> I received a further Remittance of twenty Million from your Son-in-law, so that we may speedily look to have the royal Pair in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after, a Post Chaise whirled into the Court, and <hi>Harry,</hi> flying out, caught <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Arabella</hi> into his strict Embrace.
<pb n="335" facs="336" rend="none"/>He then hurried them in, where Mr. <hi>Clin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ton</hi> received and caressed, and introduced them to the Duke and Dutchess, as Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons of great Merit, and his highly valued Friends. He then presented to them his <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> who accordingly saluted <hi>Clement,</hi> and embraced <hi>Arabella</hi> with an affectionate Familiarity.</p>
            <p>O Sir, cried our Hero, kissing his Un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cle's Hand, am I to be the last Person in the World, whom you will honour with a Sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lute from your bewitching Daughter? I ask your Pardon, my Lord, said Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> (solemnly) Allow me then, at length, to repair my Omission by presenting to your Earlship her little Highness <hi>Abenaidè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke and Dutchess and <hi>Meekly</hi> laughed. But <hi>Harry</hi> was not a whit the slower in laying hold of his Advantage. He kissed her Forehead, her Eyes, her Cheeks, and lastly dwelt upon her Lips, as though he would have infused his Soul be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween them. <hi>Harry, Harry,</hi> cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I will never introduce you to my Girl again, unless you promise not to kiss so hard and bring so much Blood into her Face.</p>
            <p>Just then a Footman entered; My Lord, says he to <hi>Harry,</hi> here are three Carriages and several Horsemen waiting
<pb n="336" facs="337" rend="none"/>without the Gate, they enquire for one Master <hi>Fenton</hi> who, they say, lives with the Earl of <hi>Moreland,</hi> but I assured them there was no such Person in the House. O Sir, said <hi>Harry,</hi> these are our old Friends the <hi>Fieldings,</hi> and out he flew.</p>
            <p>As he approached the Carriages, the Company gave a Shout of Joy. Why, Sir, said Mr. <hi>Fielding,</hi> a Servant denied you to us, and said that no One of the Name of <hi>Fenton</hi> lived here. O, says <hi>Harry,</hi> don't heed the Puppy, he is but a new Comer.</p>
            <p>He then opened the Doors of the Car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riages, and handed and kissed them, in Turns, as they came out, Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Fielding,</hi> the reverend Mr. <hi>Catharines</hi> and his sainted <hi>Phaebe,</hi> and <hi>Ned</hi> and his bloom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Bride.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> received them at the Door, with the Joy of his Heart apparent in his Countenance. He then introduced them to his most noble Brother and Sister, to his Friend <hi>Meekly,</hi> and lastly he presented his <hi>Abenaidè</hi> to them, on whom they all gazed in mute and reverential Astonishment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then observing that his Uncle had not equally presented his Daughter to <hi>Ned.</hi> Sir, says he, I apprehend that this is not quite fair; I have already kissed the
<pb n="337" facs="338" rend="none"/>fair Bride of my Friend, with all my Heart, and it is but honest that he should be fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>voured with a Salute from Mine, in turn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then took <hi>Ned</hi> by the Hand and presented him to his Beloved. While <hi>Ned</hi> bent the Knee, and touching her Hand tremblingly, looked awfully to her Face, and said: Yes, Bride of <hi>Eden,</hi> lovely Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tract of every Beauty! You alone can re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward, You alone can deserve him, You alone are fitted to be the Mate of my in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>comparable Lord and Master, my Patron and Preserver! So saying, he lightly touch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed his Lips to the polished Hand. But the Praises of her <hi>Harry</hi> had gone, with a plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sant Trickling, to the Heart of <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> and, gently raising <hi>Ned,</hi> she affectionately saluted him, with a glistening Eye.</p>
            <p>Pray Sir, said Mr. <hi>Fielding,</hi> whispering<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> is the Earl of <hi>Moreland</hi> in Company?—That is he, Sir, point<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to <hi>Harry.</hi>—O then, cried <hi>Field<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,</hi> he is titled below his Merits, it was for an Emperor that Nature intended him.</p>
            <p>Dinner was then served.—During the Repast the Duke said, Let us not, my Brother, keep our <hi>Harry</hi> in Pain: Why should we delay the Happiness of Children so very dear to us? With Regard to your Child's Marriage to some mighty Prince,
<pb n="338" facs="339" rend="none"/>as your Son-in-law hinted, I think her more ennobled and more illustrious, by her Marriage with our Hero here, who pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chased her, at his Peril, than if she were mated to the greatest Potentate on Earth.</p>
            <p>You must excuse me, my noble Brother, said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I will have no clandestine Doings in this Business. My Girl shall be married in the Face and witnessing of Thou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sands; left hereafter, this young Rogue should have the Effrontery to deny her. What Day of the Week is this, <hi>Thursday,</hi> I think, let <hi>Monday</hi> Sennight be the Day!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> rose and press'd and kiss'd the Hand of the Duke with Rapture, and then kissed the Hand of his Patron in silent Sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mission.</p>
            <p>They kept the <hi>Fieldings</hi> with them for three Days. But <hi>Harry</hi> would not part with his <hi>Clement,</hi> nor <hi>Abenaidè</hi> with <hi>Ara<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bella</hi> till the Marriage should be over. <hi>Harry,</hi> in the Presence of these two Friends, attempted to take some little accustomed Liberties, under her Name of <hi>Abenamin.</hi> But, the Proprietor of his Heart sweetly repulsed him and cried, No, no, honest Friend, I will box with you whenever, and as often as you please, but, no more wrestling, my <hi>Harry!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="340" rend="none"/>
In the mean Time, all Preparations were pushed into Forwardness by Mr. <hi>Clinton.</hi> The many Shops of the many Towns, within many Miles around, were emptied of their Boards and Sheeting, their Knives and Forks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thousands of Tables and Forms were framed, Thou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sands of Tents were erected. Proclamati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on was made in every Village, and all Peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple, within thirty Miles, invited to the Wedding.</p>
            <p>When the Day approached, one hundred Oxen were slain, five hundred Sheep, three hundred Swine, with fifty fat Deer, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> The Spits fried, and the Cauldrons smoak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed over the Fires of many a Field.</p>
            <p>At length the auspicious Morning rose; and <hi>Harry</hi> and his Bride were already up and dressed in their respective Apartments. <hi>Harry</hi> wore a Jacket and Drawers of white Satin. His Locks flowed through a Knot of oriental Pearl. And a Mantle of purple Velvet, embroidered with Needle wrought Flowers of Gold, hung over his left Shoul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der, and came under the right Arm in floating Skirts, joined at the Ends by a Buckle of Carbuncles.</p>
            <p>The Princess was habited, after the <hi>Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sian</hi> Fashion, in a Vest of Silver Brocading,
<pb n="340" facs="341" rend="none"/>scollop'd over a Petticoat of the same Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bric, that flowed in a Train behind. A Scarf of cerulean Tint flew between her right Shoulder and her left Hip, being buttoned at each End by a Rose of Rubies. Her shining Tresses of jetty Black, bound toge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther at her Neck beneath a huge Amethyst, fell down in luxuriant Ringlets, and shaded and revealed, by Turns, the fine Bend of her tapering Waist. A Coronet of Dia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monds, through which there waved a white Branch of the Feathers of the Estrich, was inserted on the left Decline of her lovely Head. And a Stomacher of inestimable Brilliants rose beneath her dazzling Bosom, and, by a fluctuating Blaze of unremitted Glory, checked and turned the Eye away from too presumptuous a Gaze.</p>
            <p>Our Hero, coming forth, beheld her, as a Pillar of Fire, just issuing from her Antichamber. He stepped back, as she advanced, and fixed his Eyes upon her in mute Astonishment; then springing for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward he fell prostrate and kissed the Hem of her Robeing. Again rising on one Knee, he lifted his Hands toward Heaven, and his Eyes to her glowing Countenance. Oppressive Power of Beauty! he cried, O, may every Day rise, like this, on my Soul-enrapturing <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> encircling her with Friendship, Love, and Joy, and the Knee of admiring Thousands!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="341" facs="342" rend="none"/>
               <hi>Arabella</hi> attended her royal Friend, and <hi>Clement</hi> his noble Pupil, just as <hi>Longfield</hi> entered to give an Account of his Expedi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion. But, he had scarce begun his Detail, when, catching the Image that had long since made an Impression on his Heart, he started and turned pale, and breaking off he cried, Bless me, my Lord, Mrs. <hi>Clement,</hi> I think! Yes, my <hi>Longfield,</hi> said <hi>Harry,</hi> and here too is your old and fast Friend <hi>Hammel Clement. Clement</hi> would not have known <hi>Longfield</hi> in his present genteel Plight; but, hearing his Name, and recol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lecting him at a Glance, he flew and seized upon him with a strenuous Embrace. <hi>Arabella</hi> then advanced to welcome her old Friend; but poor <hi>Longfield</hi> respectfully bowed and shrunk back.</p>
            <p>You shall not escape me so, my dear Mr. <hi>Longfield,</hi> says she; I cannot forget what I owe you, even my Life and Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putation; and I bless the Father of Mercies, who has put it in our Power to pay Part of our Debt, and so saying she embraced him with Freedom and Cordiality. Yes, my dear <hi>Longfield,</hi> cried <hi>Hammel,</hi> your's is the Half of our Fortunes, and more than the Half of our Hearts. Your Heart, Sir, said <hi>Longfield,</hi> will ever be most valuable; but as to any Thing additional, the Bounty of
<pb n="342" facs="343" rend="none"/>my young Master has rendered all further Fortune quite superfluous to me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Longfield</hi> then beckoned his Lord forth, that he might relate to his Eye, rather than to his Ear, the Success of his Commission. They hastened to a long Barn, where he shewed <hi>Harry</hi> two Ranges of beautiful Chil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dren, One of a hundred chosen Girls, A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nother of a hundred chosen Boys, All dressed in a clean and elegant Uniform. <hi>Harry</hi> walked between the Ranks, his Heart ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ulting in the Sense of its own divine Hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity. Then, embracing his Agent, Yes, my <hi>Longfield,</hi> he cried, These shall be in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed my Children; and I will prove a true and affectionate Father to them. But let us hasten to bestow upon them a tender Mother too, I trust.</p>
            <p>He flew back, as a Glimpse of Lighten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, and seizing and half devouring the Hand of his Bride, Will you pardon me, my Beloved, says he, some Matters that happened before our Union? I have col<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lected all the Children I ever had before Marriage. I scorn any Thing that is clan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>destine. They wait for your Inspection; and I hope that you will not prove a hard Stepmother to them. You are a Rogue, says she, archly smiling, and giving him a Pat on the Cheek; but come along, and so saying, away they tripped.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="344" rend="none"/>
The Princess walked, with a silent and musing Attention, up and down the Ranges. Her Heart grew strongly affected, and, taking out her Handkerchief, she wiped away the dropping Tear. And has my Lord, says she to <hi>Longfield,</hi> has he in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed taken upon him to be a Father to all this pretty Host of Little Ones? He has, so please your Highness, says <hi>Longfield,</hi> and has accordingly cloathed and provid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed for them. O, she cried, under the FA<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>THER, which is in Heaven, he is the dear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est and sweetest Father that ever was upon Earth! So exclaiming, she sprung at <hi>Harry,</hi> and notwithstanding her late Coyness, scarce vouchsafing a Hand to his Lips, she now grappled about his Neck, half smothering him with the Repetition of her Kisses and Caresses; and then thrusting her Face into his Bosom, she vented her Passion in Tears.</p>
            <p>On their Return, they perceived Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> the Duke and Dutchess, all stand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing in the great folding Door, and flying up the marble Steps, they Both bent the Knee, and received the joint Blessings and successive Caresses of their three exulting Parents.</p>
            <p>Just then <hi>Harry</hi> spied Goodman <hi>Dobson</hi> and his Dame coming diffidently but puff<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingly
<pb n="344" facs="345" rend="none"/>up the Avenue. Instantly he caught his Angel by the Hand and hastened to meet them. He took them successively in his Arms, and kissed them with warm Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection, while with yearning Hearts and Bowels, they wished him Joy upon Joy. They then kneeled down on each Side of the Princess, kissing her Hands and Gar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, and blessing her for bestowing such a Heaven of Beauty upon their <hi>Harry.</hi> But, as soon as <hi>Harry</hi> told her that they were his Fosterers, his very dear Daddy and Mammy; she raised and kissed them, in turns, with her Arms about their Necks; and besought them to be her Daddy and Mammy also; for, alas, says she, my Daddy and Mammy are far away. <hi>Harry</hi> then gave them into the Hands of his Man <hi>Jack,</hi> with Orders to take them to the Larder.</p>
            <p>The Multitude, before this, began to thicken apace. And the Youth had got together in the great Lawn, casting the Coit and the Sledge, and leaping over a Cord that was raised between two Posts.</p>
            <p>My lovely <hi>Harry,</hi> cried the Duke, I have heard Things, almost incredible, of your Prowess and Action, but never saw any Sample save the mounting of your <hi>Bucephealus.</hi> Will you be so good to give
<pb n="345" facs="346" rend="none"/>me some Instance of your Excellence among yonder young Competitors, whom I suppose to be the most eminent that the Shire can exhibit? Do, my <hi>Harry,</hi> said Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> clasping and kissing him, indulge my dear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est Brother on this our Day of Jubilee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> bowed, and ordered <hi>Jack</hi> to bring him his Quarterstaff, and dispatched Ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther for a Cord and two long Poles. He then walked down the Avenue, attended by the Males and Females of the whole Family.</p>
            <p>As they approached the Lawn, a Youth, of uncommon Vigour, had cleared the former Cord, though raised to something upward of five Feet in Height, but All, who attempted to follow, either recoiled or pitched over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then caused his two Poles to be erected to an Elevation of ten Feet, with a Cord reaching from Top to Top. The Multitude came down, in Thousands, to see what they were about. When <hi>Harry,</hi> having cleared the contested Cord with a standing Hop, went backward from his lofty Poles, about the Distance of thirty Paces; then, rushing forward, he advanced one End of his Staff to the Ground, and springing, and raising, and rising upon the
<pb n="346" facs="347" rend="none"/>opposite End, he pitched himself over the elevated String, while the Multitude be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>held him, as a new risen Phenix, suspend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed and glittering in the Air, and then a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lighting, as winged, on the other Side.</p>
            <p>The Elements were rent by a universal Shout, which followed and undulated after our Company, till they sheltered themselves within the House.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fieldings</hi> then arrived, with the reverable Mr. <hi>Catharines,</hi> who was ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointed to join the angelic Pair.</p>
            <p>After Breakfast, the Carriages were or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dered out. First, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and his <hi>Meekly</hi> moved away, in Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi>'s Coach and Six to the Church. The Family of the <hi>Fieldings</hi> then followed, in a Coach and Six, and two Chariots. Next went <hi>Clement</hi> and his <hi>Arabella,</hi> in their Post Chaise and Four. The Duke and Dutchess then suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeded, in a sumptuous Coach proudly drawn by Six <hi>German</hi> Greys, attended by a long Retinue of <hi>French</hi> Liveries, and the Dutchess's Women in a Coach and Four. Last advanced the Princess's four faithful <hi>Moors,</hi> mounted on fiery Coursers, and All glistering in <hi>Barbaric</hi> Gems and Adorn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments. And last of all came our Hero and his <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> enthroned in her open Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riot,
<pb n="347" facs="348" rend="none"/>as two Pearls of the Orient in a Case of burnished Gold; her six spotted <hi>Arabians,</hi> restraining their Impatience, beat Measures with their Feet, scarce seeming to advance the Pace of a Tortoise. Never will any Sight so glorious be exhibited, till the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall descend upon Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi>'s <hi>Jack</hi> closed the Rear, mounted on his Lord's rhone Charger, who stepped foaming behind the Chariot; and the long Cavalcade nearly reached from the great Hotel to the Entrance of the Town.</p>
            <p>The Crowd, however, extended wide and far beyond the Cavalcade. They bowed respectfully and payed Obeysance to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> the Duke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they passed; but as soon as they got a Glimpse of the Chariot of their young <hi>Phaeton,</hi> their Acclamations became unremitted and al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most insufferable to the Ear, like the Shouts of a <hi>Persian</hi> Army at the rising of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Slowly as our <hi>Harry</hi> moved, the Mul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>titude strove to retard him, by throwing themselves in his Way, that they might satiate their Eyes and Souls with the Ful<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of Beauty. Bended Knees and lifted Hands, Prayers, Blessings, and Exclamati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons
<pb n="348" facs="349" rend="none"/>were hear'd, and seen on all Sides; and, all the Way as they went, Thousands, upon Tens of Thousands, shouted forth the Hymeneal of the celestial Pair!</p>
