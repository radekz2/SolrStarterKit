            <p>In later times, a much easier and more com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pendious way to fame and opulence has been happily discovered: And we can now, with singular propriety, apply to the ancient practice of <hi>observation,</hi> what that lucky son of fortune <hi>Gnatho</hi> (in <hi>Terence</hi>) told an honest, simple, half-starved brother of his, on a similar occasion —
<q>
                  <l>— "Olim isti fuit</l>
                  <l>Generi quondam quaestus, apud seclum prius —</l>

<pb n="8" facs="7" rend="none"/>the art of presaging;</hi> and formed <hi>from thence</hi> a method of curing <hi>natural diseases,</hi> by means of such <hi>artificial ones</hi> as NATURE, when too lan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guid and remiss herself, never failed to point out or reveal to this her faithful minister. He had frequently observed, in the practice of his divine mistress, that a spontaneous haemorrhage of blood from the nose always mitigated, and oftentimes carried off, certain kinds of fevers, and other violent disorders. This suggested to him the practice of <hi>artificial</hi> haemorrhages by <hi>bleeding, scarification,</hi> &amp;c. which he likewise used, on certain occasions, <hi>prophylactically,</hi> or by way of prevention: For <hi>experience</hi> had taught this consummate artist, that those means which were wont to assuage bad symptoms after they appeared, would prevent their coming on, if used in proper time. He had likewise observ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, that NATURE frequently cured certain dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>eases by spontaneous abscesses in different parts of the body. When he found NATURE pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vented from working her own way, by such sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lutary operations, he substituted in their room <hi>artificial</hi> abscesses, such as <hi>issues, setons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It became farther obvious to him, that some violent disorders were carried off by a sponta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neous diarrhoea, or vomiting; others by plen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiful warm sweats, or a gentle moisture of the skin; others again by a critical discharge of urine, and some by expectoration, &amp;c.

            <p>With regard to this <hi>specific practice,</hi> (the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant political subterfuge of <hi>physic-craft</hi>) it is well known to every judicious experienced phy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sician, that the artful pretence of curing dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>eases by the occult qualities of specific remedies, is now, as it always has been, the principal source of all the knavery, impudence, and ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>norance, that we meet with in the profession.</p>
            <p>Any <hi>semicrude</hi> practitioner in this way, who is possessed of a tolerable share of cunning and address, can never want a specious pretext for making a property of his patient, almost as long as he pleases, by flattering his hopes from time to time; tho' the patient finds himself never the better, but perhaps still grows worse: If one specific succeed not, another is tried, and, if that fails, a third, and so on<note place="bottom" n="*">

                  <p>From the same cause, their dispositions are soft, coward<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, and effeminate, impatient of labour and hardship. Whatever, says he, is manly, laborious, painful, or bold and daring, [<gap rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">

Upon these accounts, the <hi>eastera Astatics</hi> are weak, timorous, and servile, easily slid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing into monarchies: With reluctance they leave their ease and families, and hazard their lives for despotic masters. On the other hand, in <hi>Greece,</hi> and the <hi>northern</hi> parts of Asia, where the temperature of the seasons is less mild, and less uniform, the men are bold, hardy, and warlike: Without compulsion they quit their ease, and voluntarily expose themselves to toil and danger, animated with the hopes, and rewarded with the fruits, of conquest.</p>
                  <p>In countries abounding with certain mines, travellers find the frame and temper of their minds suddenly altered; their intellectual faculties more sprightly and vigorous, con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceptions clearer, imagination more brisk and lively; and on passing to another soil, an universal relaxation, idea, gloomy, confused, and indistinct, immediately succeed. Thus, consonant to the philosophic notions of the DIVINE OLD MAN, the discovery, and improvement, of arts and sciences may, in some measure, depend upon the air and climate; some succeeding best, where a sprightliness of fancy, others, where intense application of mind, is re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>medicinal</hi> intention, the <hi>vivifying spirit</hi> of pure, fresh air is admirable: In acute diseases of the <hi>putrid</hi> and <hi>epidemic</hi> kind, millions of lives have been lost for want of it.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>pharmaceutic</hi> intention, air, or the humid part of it, acts as a true dissolvent, in the same manner as water in its grosser form. The cathartic and astringent virtues of certain vegetables neither volatile nor exhalable by heat, but of the fixed kind and dissoluble by <hi>menstrua</hi> alone, have been observed to be diffused through the air. Hence it appears, that the atmosphere may be impregnated with all the medicinal powers of vegetables which <hi>aqueous menstrua</hi> are capable of extracting. And upon this account it is, that, in standing, walking, or sleeping, under several kind of trees, people have found themselves variously af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fected.</p>
                  <p>The peculiar medicinal powers of certain vegetables <hi>ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>halable by heat,</hi> are, by the bye, equally remarkable and curious. In obstinate watchings, and deliriums, the au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor has, by the steams of one of this kind, procured ease, rest, and sleep, after all the usual internal sedative medi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cines had been tried in vain.</p>
                  <p>In acute diseases of the malignant kind, where sweating was indicated, but could not be procured by any internal means, the effluvia of a vegetable, applied in a certain manner to the external surface of the body, have proved an efficacious sudorific.</p>
                  <p>From a variety of similar experiments, and certain ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>servations on the oeconomy of Nature, respecting cuticular inhalations, a physiological conjecture is drawn, namely, that the human body is endued with some secret energetic power of attracting such salutary particles as it may be in immediate need of, from surrounding bodies which contain them.—Hence, old persons, and those whom long and te<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dious indispositions had brought to the last stage of life, have, by the effluvia of young, sound, and healthy ani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mals, been surprizingly recruited, strengthened, and invi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gorated.</p>
                  <p>In Persia, Arabia, and other eastern countries, at cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain seasons of the year, the people are obliged, by the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessive heat of the weather, to lie down at night to sleep, on the tops of their houses, in balconies, turrets, &amp;c. ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed to the open air, and dews, which are so copious, notwithstanding the excessive heat, during the time of sleep, that the body is cooled, preserved from thirst, and refresh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed by its absorbent power of attracting or inhaling the dews; provided there be any perceivable saltness in the taste of those dews: On the contrary, if the dews have not a saline taste, it is then found dangerous to sleep in the open air, and frequently attended with pernicious, and sometimes fatal consequences.</p>

            <p>Now, the orthodox medical processes, and formulae, of our specific practitioners, in those, commonly denominated, arthritic, scorbutic, hysteric, and hypocondriac disorders, consist chiefly of hot vegetable aromatics, bitters, and astringents, infused in strong wines or spirits; the volatile oils and spirits of vegetables and

Thus, for instance, our <hi>Harrowgate waters</hi> (which have been found so efficacious in cutaneous foulnesses, blotches, scabs, scrophulas, lepro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sies, &amp;c.) are strongly impregnated with sulphur and a kind of lixivial salt, as hath been proved by mixing a certain quantity of sulphur with salt of tartar, melting them over a gentle fire till perfectly incorporated, and then dissolving the mass in pure water.—If then we know the component parts of these waters, why should we not expect the same good effects from the <hi>artificial</hi> as from the <hi>natural</hi> baths made of them, agreeably to this ingenious writer's observa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion?
<p>Medicated baths must have been of very high antiquity; since we find, by the best authenticated accounts, that the ancient Jews and Egyptians made use of them in curing the most obstinate and desperate maladies.—Virgil, singing the praises of his favourite <hi>Iapis—'Phoebo ante alios dilectus,'</hi> (who was cotemporary with the sons of <hi>Esculapius</hi>) intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duces him using a <hi>medicated bath</hi> in the cure of father <hi>Aene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>as;</hi> and says of him, that being greatly beloved by Apollo, he offered to teach him <hi>augury, to play on the harp,</hi> and <hi>to draw the bow</hi> well; but that he rather chose <hi>to prolong: he dying father's life, to learn the virtues of plants,</hi> and <hi>to cure diseases</hi>—</p>

                  <p>That the wonderful power of absorbency in all the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ternal (as well as internal) parts of the human body was well known to Hippocrates, appears from the following passage in the sixth book of his <hi>Epidemics</hi>—<gap rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">

I went to her cottage, where she cut the plant she had ga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thered into small shreds, and boiled it with a little piece of fat meat, and made a soup with the ingredients, on which herself, her husband, two children, and an old woman, made an hearty meal; and, what I own greatly surprized me, without any damage or bad consequence.

               </gap>) above eighteen hundred years ago<note place="bottom" n="*">The very learned and ingenious Dr. Middleton, in his 'Dissertation on the state of physicians among the old Ro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mans,' makes Asclepiades cotemporary with Cicero; who, in his first dialogue <hi>de Oratore,</hi> introduceth Lucius Crassus speaking of him as his intimate friend and physician—"Neque vero Asclepiades, is, says he, quo nos medico amicoque usi sumus, tum, cum eloquentia vincebat caete<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ros medicos, in eo ipso quod ornate dicebat, medicinae fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cultate utebatur, non eloquentiae."—He likewise asserts, that when Asclepiades came first to Rome, he knew nothing of physic; contrary to the express testimony of Caelius Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>relianus, Oribasius, and other authentic documents, from which it plainly appears, that he practised physic at Parium, and other cities bordering upon the Hellespont, and even at Athens, (where we find him treated with particular marks of distinction by the celebrated philosopher Antio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chus Academicus, afterwards preceptor to Cicero) long be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore he settled at Rome. The Doctor's other assertion, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>specting the friendship and intimacy between Asclepiades and Cicero, includes a manifest anachronism, really sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prizing in so great a critic, more especially in one who has elsewhere given such ample proofs of his knowledge in the biographical history of those times; and what adds to our wonder on this occasion is, that he quotes the above passage from Cicero's <hi>Orator</hi> in support of it: But whoever will be at the trouble of comparing the genuine memoirs anti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quity has given of the life, social connexions, and death, of L. Crassus, one of the principal interlocutors in the <hi>Ora<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tor,</hi> and the ingenious account the Doctor himself gives of those highly finished and truely admirable dialogues, in his history of Cicero's life, with that remarkable quotation of Sextus Empiricus—<hi>adversus Logicos, sect.</hi> 201—from a ce<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lebrated work of the just-mentioned Antiochus, published much about the same time the scene of these <hi>dialogues</hi> was laid at the <hi>Tusculanum</hi> of Crassus, [i. e. in the year of Rome 66z, when Crassus, who died soon after, was 56 years old, and Cicero but a youth of sixteen] in which he makes ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nourable mention of Asclepiades, but as who had been some time dead—I say, whoever collates these several accounts, will presently discover Doctor Middleton's pal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pable misinterpretation of this passage in Cicero.—This Asclepiades was indisputably the greatest master antiquity can count in the <hi>medicina politica:</hi> By a peculiar attention to the passions, and foibles of human nature, he was ena<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bled to discover an universal propension in mankind to be deceived—From thence he took the hint of <hi>advancing his fortune,</hi> by cultivating this <hi>ductile propension</hi> to the highest pitch it was capable of; and in defence of this practice the following argument was originally invented, and occasio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nally urged—<hi>Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur;</hi> which has been used, on similar occasions, ever since. He first in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vented the <hi>lecti pensiles,</hi> or hanging beds, in which the sick might, with great facility, be rocked to sleep. These anodyne machines of his took prodigiously: Many of his noble patients had them made of silver; and they after<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards became a considerable part of the Roman luxury.
<p>Notwithstanding the boundless strife of opinions that un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>happily attended physic after the death of its great parent <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the ancient pharmacy still preserved its foot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, in some degree, as likewise the Hippocratic doctrine, till this <hi>arch-craftsman</hi> of the profession had the cunning and address to demolish the whole, calling it, in derision, 'a meditation upon death.'—He made the whole <hi>materia medica</hi> to consist only of such things as would give ease, and exhilerate the spirits of the patient: Nay, in certain cases he administered to the luxury of his patients, and indulged them in the use of wine, even to intoxication. This flat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tering of the palate, in conjunction with his new amusive inventions, and a lucky accident of his discovering some signs of life in a man that was carrying to be buried, whom he soon recovered, and whom the people were persuaded to believe he had raised from the dead, conspired to make him the supreme archiater of those times; and what still farther contributed to establish him in this elevated station, was his having publicly challenged the Fates, by constantly de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>claring that he should never be visited by any bodily di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stemper. Nay, Pliny the historian informs us, he held diseases and prematurity of death so much in defiance, that he would frequently, amongst his acquaintances, offer to lay any wager, and even to stake his whole fortune, that he should never be sick, as in fact he never was, not even at the time of his death; for that he broke his neck by a fall down a pair of stairs.</p>
               </note>. But this hypothesis, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
<pb n="38" facs="37" rend="none"/>specious, however recommended, by the sanction of antiquity, and the later authority of
<pb n="39" facs="38" rend="none"/>great names, has always appeared to the author unsupported by Reason and FACTS.—The most plausible argument he has met with, in favour of this <hi>theory,</hi> is, that in acute diseases of the eruptive kind, and particularly in the <hi>small-pox,</hi> 'as soon as the morbific matter is expelled to the surface of the body, the fever ceases:" therefore, 'the fever is an effort of NATURE to relieve herself.' But it is well known to every experienced practitioner, that the less the
<pb n="40" facs="39" rend="none"/>fever is in the natural small-pox, the fewer will be the pustules, and the variolous matter more happily expelled; or, according to our great <hi>Sydenbam, [Angliae lumen, artis Phaebum]</hi> "Quo sedatior est sanguis eo melius erumpent pus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tulae."</p>
            <p>It has indeed been a received opinion, almost ever since the first appearance of the small<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pox<note place="bottom" n="*">The small-pox was first described, and treated of by <hi>Aaron</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his <hi>Pandects of physic,</hi> which he published about the middle of the <hi>seventh century,</hi> accord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to <hi>Haly Abbas</hi>'s account. But as the original works of this author, in the Syriac tongue, and the Arabic transla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of them by Maserjawaihus, are both lost, and nothing of them now remains, but some extracts, which <hi>Mohamed Rhazes</hi> has left us in his <hi>Continens;</hi> we have no certain ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count extant of the precise aera of this disease, nor in what country it first appeared. The most probable opinion is, that it had its rise in <hi>Arabia Faelix,</hi> and was brought from thence to <hi>Alexandria</hi> by the <hi>Arabs,</hi> when they took that city, A. D. 640, in the reign of <hi>Omar Ebnol Chatab,</hi> the second successor to <hi>Mohamed:</hi> For <hi>Paulus</hi> of <hi>Aegina,</hi> who lived at <hi>Alexandria</hi> about <hi>twenty years</hi> before, makes no mention of it in his works; though he assures us, in his preface, that he had treated of every disease <hi>then</hi> known. From this time, the small-pox spread, with amazing rapi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dity, wherever the <hi>Saracens</hi> extended their conquests: West<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward into <hi>Spain,</hi> about 30 years after, according to <hi>Ockley;</hi> and eastward as far as <hi>Japan,</hi> whither it was carried near the same time, as <hi>Kaempfer</hi> informs us.—Respecting the practice of the celebrated <hi>Rhazes</hi> above-mentioned, it may not be impertinent to remark, on this occasion, that he carried the <hi>cold regimen</hi> farther than it has been ever carried since, even by Mr. Sutton himself, as evidently appears from his method of treating the <hi>small-pox</hi> and <hi>measles.</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="40" rend="none"/>is always required, to concoct, separate, and expel, the vitiated and infectious matter.' But Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> (the reputed author of the new method of inoculation; though, by the bye, the very same method, <hi>in every essential point,</hi> was practised by <hi>Mr. Glass,</hi> an eminent surgeon in the university of Oxford, long before Mr. Sutton was known) has fully demonstrated, by many thousands of successful experiments, that the <hi>fever</hi> in this disease is so far from being 'NATURE'S instrument to expel an enemy,' that <hi>itself</hi> is her greatest enemy; and conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently ought to be <hi>prevented,</hi> or <hi>extinguished</hi>

And, in his peculiar attention to this single point, the author has sufficient reason to believe Mr. Sutton's SUPERIOR success wholly consists: For, having had many favourable opportunities, during several years, of ascer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taining, by means of a most accurately-made <hi>pyranthropometer,</hi> the natural heat of the body, in Mr. Sutton's patients, when in perfect health, immediately before their entering on his prepa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ratory course, and afterwards during the pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gress of the disease; he found, in a variety of instances of a <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> small pox,

            <p>The most distinguished ancient physicians of the <hi>Hippocratic</hi> school, had no other <hi>idea</hi> of a fever than <hi>that</hi> of their great master—viz. a <hi>fiery</hi> or <hi>preternatural heat.</hi> This preternatural heat they conceived of, as a <hi>symptom,</hi> the cure of which was the province of the physician; whilst the removing, and carrying off, the <hi>pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mary cause</hi> of this symptom, that is, the cure of the <hi>disease,</hi> was considered chiefly as the work of NATURE. Now, the <hi>primary cause</hi> of every fever is, as the author conceives, some <hi>stimulant or acrid matter spasmodically affecting the vascular and nervous system:</hi> Whether this matter be, 1st. A <hi>foreign substance</hi> lodged in the flesh—2dly, A <hi>putrid fomes</hi> absorbed into the habit, from gun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shot wounds, &amp;c. in removing these two causes, NATURE may often require the <hi>surgeon's</hi> helping hand—3dly, <hi>Deleterious miasmata</hi> residing in the air—4thly, A <hi>putrid fomes</hi> of any kind, produ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cing an <hi>acrimonious</hi> state of the fluids—5thly, <hi>Purulent matter</hi> lodged in the body, from inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal suppurations—Or, 6thly, <hi>external cold,</hi> or, what is usually called <hi>catching of cold.</hi> This last mentioned, and, perhaps, most frequent cause of fevers, has been generally supposed to be the <hi>materia perspirabilis</hi> of <hi>Sanctorius</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">The doctrine of perspiration, though it owes its name, and present establishment, to Sanctorius, was not unknown to the ancient Greek physicians. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> believed all the surfaces of the parts of a human body, as well those of the muscles and viscera, as of the skin, to be naturally in a continual state of perspiration.—The following remarkable observation is <hi>Galen</hi>'s (<hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de tuenda sanitate</hi>) "Prospi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciendum est, ut eorum quae eduntur et bibuntur, respectu eorum quae expelluntur, conveniens mediocritas servetur: Sane is modus servabitur, si ponderabitur a nobis in utris<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>que quantitas."
<p>From this passage in Galen, Sanctorius undoubtedly took the first hint of his <hi>statical</hi> experiments for ascertain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the daily waste of the animal fluids, made by the out<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lets of the external superficies of the body, and by the lungs: But it is impossible to ascertain the quantity of this waste, without knowing, at the same time, the quantity of moisture, &amp;c. absorbed or imbibed by the pores of the skin and lungs; <hi>which Sanctorius did not advert to:</hi> For the author of this, after violent exercise in riding, notwith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing a great expence of perspirable matter, and no food taken, has, in certain constitutions of the air and atmo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sphere, facilitating the <hi>cutaneous immissions,</hi> often found him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, by most exact statical experiments, many ounces, some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times twenty and upwards heavier than he was before. Hence it appears, that all we can with certainty discover, respect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the quantity of <hi>sanctorian</hi> perspiration, by experiments of this kind, is, the difference between the <hi>exhalata</hi> and the <hi>inhalata,</hi> that is, between the perspirable matter we exhale from the pores of the skin and lungs, and whatever we imbibe or inhale through the same: For exhalation and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>halation so confound each other as to render it impossible to ascertain the exact quantity of either; as the author pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poses, in a short time, to demonstrate more at large to the medical reader.</p>

            <p>On this preservative branch of medicine, and particularly on the <hi>dietetic</hi> part of it, a multi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude of books have been written; many of them by physicians of eminence, with a spirit of phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lanthropy that does honour to the profession. But, as those productions consist chiefly of ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neral rules laid down for mankind without di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stinction, to preserve their health, and prolong their lives, they have not proved in any degree adequate to the proposed end: For, so infinite is the variety of constitutions, (in respect of which all food acts, by a certain immutable law of Nature, <hi>relatively &amp; secundum quid,</hi> as logi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cians express it, not <hi>absolutely &amp; per se</hi>) that any general rule laid down to any number of men, for this purpose, must be hurtful or de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>structive to the greatest part of them at least,

            <p>In general, the best rule, perhaps, that can be laid down, for preserving health, and pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>longing life, is (what the most elegant <hi>Celsus</hi> recommended to the world sixteen hundred years ago) <hi>to observe strictly no particular rule at all;</hi> but, upon the rational principle of mode<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration and temperance <hi>[noverca medicorum],</hi> to follow the sober dictates of Nature; who has not ordained a single want to man, the <hi>reasona<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble</hi> satisfaction of which, (besides its manifest subserviency to health) does not afford a plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure every way superior to what can be found in any unnatural gratification of the appetities: For true pleasure is the bounty of Nature, and Reason her dispenser of it.</p>
            <p>To conclude—In spite of all the false refine<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments of art, the true sublime of taste, and the sweet simplicity of Nature, will for ever continue inseparable.

            <p>ONE of the most troublesome and ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stinate complaints, to which chil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dren are liable, is the HOOPING COUGH. The methods of treating it hitherto in use, have generally been found ineffectual to stop its progress, or to suppress it with safe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, before it hath run its natural course.—</p>
            <p>OUR great master in physic, DR. SYDEN<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>HAM, in his account of it says—"What others may be able to do in this disease, I know not: as for myself, I have used abundance of all sorts of medicines, and still lost my labour."</p>
            <p>THE author of the foregoing discourse, whose practice is much among children, therefore informs the public, that by a long series of experimental inquiries into the nature and causes of the diseases of chil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dren in general, and of this hitherto in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tractable, and frequently fatal one in par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular, he has discovered a safe and easy method of treating it with success.</p>
